In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. “The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That’s why we as a nation didn’t perform well,” Akram said A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company’s ball. Please, mend your ways.” ICC Head of Events Chris Tetley said the one-day international (ODI) tournament had been a ""great success."" Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia’s World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- “It's a lot better than seeing the World Cup on the couch at home,” said Travis Head as a smile crept across his face. Cricket-obsessed India was left grappling for answers Monday after the team's devastating defeat to Australia in the final of their home World Cup extended a drought in global tournaments. The issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""I think that's been almost faultless, to be honest,” Ponting told Sky Sports after the match. Leading run scorer Virat Kohli — who was named player of the tournament — captain Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and top wicket-taker Mohammed Shami were all included in the team. “It’s tough to watch boys like this,” Dravid told the media after his team’s heartbreaking six-wicket loss to Australia in the final.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents. Pakistan denies this and accuses India of violating the rights of Kashmir's Muslim people, a charge India rejects. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Five key moments from the 2023 Cricket World Cup final on Sunday as Australia defeated India by six wickets: Wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestinian flag, and a T-shirt with the slogan ""Stop Bombing Palestine"", the unnamed young protester ran onto the pitch in the 132,000-seat mega-stadium in India's western city of Ahmedabad. This is the longest boundary-less sequence (off the bat) for any team other than the Netherlands in this World Cup India posted 240 runs after being sent into bat first Drivers honked at fans blocking roads, shouting slogans and bargaining with roadside hawkers hours before the Sunday afternoon finale between the cricket-crazy hosts and the game's traditional powerhouse Australia.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Taijul Islam completed a 10-wicket-haul as Bangladesh brought up their maiden home Test victory over New Zealand, defeating the Kiwis by 150 runs on the fifth day of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Taijul, who had claimed four wickets in the first innings, hit the final nail on New Zealand's coffin on the day, by getting Ish Sodhi (22) caught at silly point to bowl out the visitors for 181. Taijul took two of the three remaining wickets on the day while Nayeem Hasan claimed the other. Earlier, Bangladesh conceded a seven-run lead in the first innings. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's century and a couple of fifties from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz helped the Tigers set a daunting 332-run target. Bangladesh had New Zealand on the ropes by the end of the fourth day when they reduced them to 113-7. It took the hosts less than 90 minutes in the morning session to complete the victory. With the result, Bangladesh have started the third cycle of the ICC Test Championship with a victory. This is also their second ever win in the competition, the previous one coming in the second cycle against the same opponents in Mount Maunganui in 2021. Bangladesh also take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series with the win. The next Test will be played in Dhaka, starting on December 6. Bangladesh need three wickets on Day five to win Sylhet Test Taijul Islam completed his 12th five-wicket haul in Tests by ending the counter-attacking knock from Tim Southee as Bangladesh are now just one wicket away from winning the first Test on Day five at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today.

"Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's overzealous approach cost him his wicket late in the morning session as Bangladesh went into the lunch interval on 104-2 on the first day of their Sylhet Test against New Zealand today. Shanto, who played a brisk knock of 37 off 35 balls, threw away his wicket with less than 10 minutes to go before lunch, top-edging a full toss delivery from part-time spinner Glenn Philipps to get caught by Kane Williamson. Philipps' scalp, which was his maiden wicket in Test cricket, broke a 53-run partnership between Shanto and Mahmudul Hasan Joy and helped the visitors end the session on equal standings. Joy is now batting on 42 and he is accompanied in the middle by Mominul Haque, who is unbeaten on three. Earlier, New Zealand's first success in the innings came from left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, whose sharp turning delivery rattled Zakir Hasan's off stump, ending his innings on 12. Batting first, Joy and Zakir successfully negated the opening spell of New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson. After the seamers failed to bring the breakthrough, skipper Southee handed the ball to Ajaz, who broke the opening stand on 39 with a sharp turning delivery, signs of things to come later in the match. Shanto, who is leading the side in place of injured skipper Shakib Al Hasan, then came to the middle with a clear plan to attack the Kiwi spinners to unsettle them. He opened his account with a six straight down the ground against Ajaz and hit the spinner for a four two balls later. Shanto hit Ajaz for a couple more sixes and a four, which forced Southee to take the spinner off the attack. But his over-aggressive approach eventually caused his dismissal. The pitch in Sylhet has already shown signs of turn and inconsistent bounce, which should aid the hosts who have gone into the match with three spinners – Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan and Taijul Islam – and just one pacer in Shoriful Islam. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Kyle Jamieson also returns to the squad after back surgery in February in a pace attack which includes captain Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who has recovered from injury. New Zealand's spin options are bolstered by all-rounders Ravindra, who is back in the squad for the first time since facing Bangladesh in January last year, and Glenn Phillips, who returns after touring Pakistan earlier this year.

"New Zealand were 260 for 7 trailing Bangladesh by 29 runs in their first innings when play was abandoned for the day due to rain in the second Test at Hagley Oval, Christchurch today. Earlier, Bangladesh and New Zealand stepped onto the Hagley Oval for the start of the second day. New Zealand’s openers were out in the middle as the hosts began their reply to Bangladesh 289 on the first day. Pacer Tim Southee took a five-wicket haul on day one to restrict Bangladesh’s total after they had gotten a decent platform to build on from Shakib Al Hasan and Soumya Sarkar. Soumya and Shakib stitched together a 127-run third-wicket stand to repair the innings after Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah Riyad and were looking shaky. Soumya returned to form with a brilliant 86, while Shakib added 59. Following the dismissal of those two, rookies Nurul Hasan and Nazmul Hossain batted patiently, with the former adding 47.

"Shakib Al Hasan got three wickets off nine deliveries deep into the final session on the second day as Bangladesh came back strongly in the second Test against New Zealand at the Hagley Oval today. The home side was reduced to 260-7 in response to Bangladesh’s first-innings total of 289 before rain stopped play after 77 overs. The champion Bangladesh all-rounder started a rush of wickets when he had Mitchell Santner trapped in front for 29. Santner reviewed the decision which was overruled by the third umpire. The home side reduced to 252-5. It soon turned 256-7 when wicketkeeper-batsman BJ Watling dragged an attempted cut on to his stump for 1 and Colin de Grandhomme was clean bowled by a clever arm ball for a three-ball duck. Santner put on 75 runs for the fifth wicket with Henry Nicholls, who was unbeaten on 56 when the day’s play was called off due to rain. But Nicholls was lucky to be still there when umpire Nigel Llong ruled him not out despite replay showed he edged Taskin Ahmed behind the wicket when he was on 45. Bangladesh had exhausted both their reviews by that time. Earlier, there was no record-equaling century for Ross Taylor. The New Zealand batsman got out on 77 and his side were reduced to 177-4 just before Tea. The right-hander, needing one more century to equal Black Caps great Martin Crowe’s 17 Test ton, suffered a soft dismissal. He clipped a flighted delivery from Mehedi Hasan straight to mid-wicket where the substitute fielder Taijul Islam took the catch. Umpire Nigel Llong was not sure whether it was a bump catch and he referred it to the third umpire and replays confirmed his dismissal. Taylor got a life just before his dismissal when he was dropped at deep square leg when he was on 75. Earlier, Taskin Ahmed broke the resolute century partnership for the third wicket when he had Tom Latham caught behind in the first over after the post-lunch drinks break. Latham, on 68, slashed the ball but only got an inside edge which carried to wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan. It ended the 106-run stand between the left-handed opener and Ross Taylor. Pace bowler Kamrul Islam Rabbi struck twice in his opening over to rattle New Zealand on the second day of the second Test at the Hagley Oval. He struck with the second ball of his first over. Coming in from the Pavilion End in place of Taskin Ahmed, the right-arm pacer had Jeet Raval bowled for 16. The left-hander chopped a rising ball onto his stumps, putting an end to a 45-tun opening stand with Tom Latham. Kamrul then struck with the fourth ball of the same over when he had New Zealand captain Kane Williamson caught behind with a pitched up delivery. The Black Caps’ captain came forward and edged the out-swinger to Nurul Hasan behind the wicket, reducing the Kiwis to 47 for two in their chase of Bangladesh’s first innings total of 289. In that eventful over Kamul also almost drew Ross Taylor into a false shot. Taylor tentatively pushed on the on side and the ball fell just short at short mid-wicket, where Shakib Al Hasan took the ball off the first bounce. The way Kamrul and Rubel bowled in tandem was a sight to behold in overcast conditions on a lively pitch. Both bowlers have all sorts of problem for Latham, and Taylor in particular, who was playing and missing against Rubel. The pace bowler also hit Latham on the grille with a ferocious bouncer, which sent the back protection of the left-hander’s helmet to go flying. Rubel finished his first spell with 6-1-13-0. He was unlucky not to get a wicket after bowling so well. The home team survived a barrage of hostile stuff from Kamrul and Rubel and went for a nervy lunch at 70-2 with Latham on 38 and Taylor looking very uncomfortable on 10.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...
