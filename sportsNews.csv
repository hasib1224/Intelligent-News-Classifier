In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. “The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That’s why we as a nation didn’t perform well,” Akram said A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company’s ball. Please, mend your ways.” ICC Head of Events Chris Tetley said the one-day international (ODI) tournament had been a ""great success."" Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia’s World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- “It's a lot better than seeing the World Cup on the couch at home,” said Travis Head as a smile crept across his face. Cricket-obsessed India was left grappling for answers Monday after the team's devastating defeat to Australia in the final of their home World Cup extended a drought in global tournaments. The issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""I think that's been almost faultless, to be honest,” Ponting told Sky Sports after the match. Leading run scorer Virat Kohli — who was named player of the tournament — captain Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and top wicket-taker Mohammed Shami were all included in the team. “It’s tough to watch boys like this,” Dravid told the media after his team’s heartbreaking six-wicket loss to Australia in the final.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents. Pakistan denies this and accuses India of violating the rights of Kashmir's Muslim people, a charge India rejects. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Five key moments from the 2023 Cricket World Cup final on Sunday as Australia defeated India by six wickets: Wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestinian flag, and a T-shirt with the slogan ""Stop Bombing Palestine"", the unnamed young protester ran onto the pitch in the 132,000-seat mega-stadium in India's western city of Ahmedabad. This is the longest boundary-less sequence (off the bat) for any team other than the Netherlands in this World Cup India posted 240 runs after being sent into bat first Drivers honked at fans blocking roads, shouting slogans and bargaining with roadside hawkers hours before the Sunday afternoon finale between the cricket-crazy hosts and the game's traditional powerhouse Australia.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Taijul Islam completed a 10-wicket-haul as Bangladesh brought up their maiden home Test victory over New Zealand, defeating the Kiwis by 150 runs on the fifth day of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Taijul, who had claimed four wickets in the first innings, hit the final nail on New Zealand's coffin on the day, by getting Ish Sodhi (22) caught at silly point to bowl out the visitors for 181. Taijul took two of the three remaining wickets on the day while Nayeem Hasan claimed the other. Earlier, Bangladesh conceded a seven-run lead in the first innings. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's century and a couple of fifties from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz helped the Tigers set a daunting 332-run target. Bangladesh had New Zealand on the ropes by the end of the fourth day when they reduced them to 113-7. It took the hosts less than 90 minutes in the morning session to complete the victory. With the result, Bangladesh have started the third cycle of the ICC Test Championship with a victory. This is also their second ever win in the competition, the previous one coming in the second cycle against the same opponents in Mount Maunganui in 2021. Bangladesh also take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series with the win. The next Test will be played in Dhaka, starting on December 6. Bangladesh need three wickets on Day five to win Sylhet Test Taijul Islam completed his 12th five-wicket haul in Tests by ending the counter-attacking knock from Tim Southee as Bangladesh are now just one wicket away from winning the first Test on Day five at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today.

"Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's overzealous approach cost him his wicket late in the morning session as Bangladesh went into the lunch interval on 104-2 on the first day of their Sylhet Test against New Zealand today. Shanto, who played a brisk knock of 37 off 35 balls, threw away his wicket with less than 10 minutes to go before lunch, top-edging a full toss delivery from part-time spinner Glenn Philipps to get caught by Kane Williamson. Philipps' scalp, which was his maiden wicket in Test cricket, broke a 53-run partnership between Shanto and Mahmudul Hasan Joy and helped the visitors end the session on equal standings. Joy is now batting on 42 and he is accompanied in the middle by Mominul Haque, who is unbeaten on three. Earlier, New Zealand's first success in the innings came from left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, whose sharp turning delivery rattled Zakir Hasan's off stump, ending his innings on 12. Batting first, Joy and Zakir successfully negated the opening spell of New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson. After the seamers failed to bring the breakthrough, skipper Southee handed the ball to Ajaz, who broke the opening stand on 39 with a sharp turning delivery, signs of things to come later in the match. Shanto, who is leading the side in place of injured skipper Shakib Al Hasan, then came to the middle with a clear plan to attack the Kiwi spinners to unsettle them. He opened his account with a six straight down the ground against Ajaz and hit the spinner for a four two balls later. Shanto hit Ajaz for a couple more sixes and a four, which forced Southee to take the spinner off the attack. But his over-aggressive approach eventually caused his dismissal. The pitch in Sylhet has already shown signs of turn and inconsistent bounce, which should aid the hosts who have gone into the match with three spinners – Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan and Taijul Islam – and just one pacer in Shoriful Islam. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Kyle Jamieson also returns to the squad after back surgery in February in a pace attack which includes captain Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who has recovered from injury. New Zealand's spin options are bolstered by all-rounders Ravindra, who is back in the squad for the first time since facing Bangladesh in January last year, and Glenn Phillips, who returns after touring Pakistan earlier this year.

"New Zealand were 260 for 7 trailing Bangladesh by 29 runs in their first innings when play was abandoned for the day due to rain in the second Test at Hagley Oval, Christchurch today. Earlier, Bangladesh and New Zealand stepped onto the Hagley Oval for the start of the second day. New Zealand’s openers were out in the middle as the hosts began their reply to Bangladesh 289 on the first day. Pacer Tim Southee took a five-wicket haul on day one to restrict Bangladesh’s total after they had gotten a decent platform to build on from Shakib Al Hasan and Soumya Sarkar. Soumya and Shakib stitched together a 127-run third-wicket stand to repair the innings after Bangladesh lost Tamim Iqbal and Mahmudullah Riyad and were looking shaky. Soumya returned to form with a brilliant 86, while Shakib added 59. Following the dismissal of those two, rookies Nurul Hasan and Nazmul Hossain batted patiently, with the former adding 47.

"Shakib Al Hasan got three wickets off nine deliveries deep into the final session on the second day as Bangladesh came back strongly in the second Test against New Zealand at the Hagley Oval today. The home side was reduced to 260-7 in response to Bangladesh’s first-innings total of 289 before rain stopped play after 77 overs. The champion Bangladesh all-rounder started a rush of wickets when he had Mitchell Santner trapped in front for 29. Santner reviewed the decision which was overruled by the third umpire. The home side reduced to 252-5. It soon turned 256-7 when wicketkeeper-batsman BJ Watling dragged an attempted cut on to his stump for 1 and Colin de Grandhomme was clean bowled by a clever arm ball for a three-ball duck. Santner put on 75 runs for the fifth wicket with Henry Nicholls, who was unbeaten on 56 when the day’s play was called off due to rain. But Nicholls was lucky to be still there when umpire Nigel Llong ruled him not out despite replay showed he edged Taskin Ahmed behind the wicket when he was on 45. Bangladesh had exhausted both their reviews by that time. Earlier, there was no record-equaling century for Ross Taylor. The New Zealand batsman got out on 77 and his side were reduced to 177-4 just before Tea. The right-hander, needing one more century to equal Black Caps great Martin Crowe’s 17 Test ton, suffered a soft dismissal. He clipped a flighted delivery from Mehedi Hasan straight to mid-wicket where the substitute fielder Taijul Islam took the catch. Umpire Nigel Llong was not sure whether it was a bump catch and he referred it to the third umpire and replays confirmed his dismissal. Taylor got a life just before his dismissal when he was dropped at deep square leg when he was on 75. Earlier, Taskin Ahmed broke the resolute century partnership for the third wicket when he had Tom Latham caught behind in the first over after the post-lunch drinks break. Latham, on 68, slashed the ball but only got an inside edge which carried to wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan. It ended the 106-run stand between the left-handed opener and Ross Taylor. Pace bowler Kamrul Islam Rabbi struck twice in his opening over to rattle New Zealand on the second day of the second Test at the Hagley Oval. He struck with the second ball of his first over. Coming in from the Pavilion End in place of Taskin Ahmed, the right-arm pacer had Jeet Raval bowled for 16. The left-hander chopped a rising ball onto his stumps, putting an end to a 45-tun opening stand with Tom Latham. Kamrul then struck with the fourth ball of the same over when he had New Zealand captain Kane Williamson caught behind with a pitched up delivery. The Black Caps’ captain came forward and edged the out-swinger to Nurul Hasan behind the wicket, reducing the Kiwis to 47 for two in their chase of Bangladesh’s first innings total of 289. In that eventful over Kamul also almost drew Ross Taylor into a false shot. Taylor tentatively pushed on the on side and the ball fell just short at short mid-wicket, where Shakib Al Hasan took the ball off the first bounce. The way Kamrul and Rubel bowled in tandem was a sight to behold in overcast conditions on a lively pitch. Both bowlers have all sorts of problem for Latham, and Taylor in particular, who was playing and missing against Rubel. The pace bowler also hit Latham on the grille with a ferocious bouncer, which sent the back protection of the left-hander’s helmet to go flying. Rubel finished his first spell with 6-1-13-0. He was unlucky not to get a wicket after bowling so well. The home team survived a barrage of hostile stuff from Kamrul and Rubel and went for a nervy lunch at 70-2 with Latham on 38 and Taylor looking very uncomfortable on 10.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Taijul Islam broke through the castle of Kane Williamson close to the end of the second day as New Zealand were 266 for eight before bad light put an end to the day's play in Sylhet. The New Zealand batter scored 104 runs off 205 deliveries -- his innings featuring two dropped-chances -- as New Zealand ate away at the Bangladesh total on a gripping second day at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium. Kyle Jamieson (7) and Tim Southee (1) will start the third day's play tomorrow. Taijul was the most successful of the Bangladesh bowlers with four wickets for 89 runs. The three other bowlers and part-timer Mominul Haque got a wicket each. Williamson rides luck to reach 29th century Kane Williamson rode his luck on his way to a 29th Test century in the first Test against Bangladesh in Sylhet today. The Kiwi veteran was dropped twice -- on 63 and 70 -- both off the bowling of off-spinner Nayeem Hasan on way to a fighting century in testing conditions as New Zealand ate away at the deficit. The Kiwi batter brought up his century off hundred off 189 deliveries as New Zealand were 255 for six, chasing Bangladesh's first-innings total of 310. Glenn Phillips had just been dismissed by part-time spinner Mominul Haque for 42, that dismissal bringing an end to a 78-run partnership. Taijul ends Mitchell's charmed life Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam sent back Daryll Mitchell with a beautifully disguised delivery but Kane Williamson was trudging along as New Zealand continued to chip away at Bangladesh's first-innings total of 310 on the second day of the Sylhet Test today. Mitchell fell for a 64-ball 41, having survived a couple of close calls -- an edge to the keeper which the umpire didn't give out and Bangladesh didn't appeal for and then a chip which fell agonisingly short of the fielder. However, Taijul's guile drew him in front and keeper Nurul Hasan made no mistake in uprooting the bails, ending a 66-run fourth-wicket stand. Earlier, Shoriful Islam had got rid of Henry Nicholls for 19 shortly before he was unlucky not to take the scalp of Mitchell. Williamson, meanwhile, soldiered along on 66 runs off 110 deliveries and has Tom Blundell for company as New Zealand will start the last session of the day at 168 for four.

Williamson was batting on 26 off 35 deliveries while Nicholls was on 11 off 25.  Miraz dismisses Conway, NZ lose both openers Bangladesh off-spinner Mehedi Hasan Miraz dismissed New Zealand opener Devon Conway for 12 to leave the visitors two down for 46 after 16 overs on Day Two of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. Miraz got one to go on with the arm from round the wicket as it got the inside edge of Conway bat after which it scooped off the pads to silly point. The dismissal brought Henry Nicholls to the crease, with Kane Williamson unbeaten on eight at the other end. Taijul gives Bangladesh first breakthrough Bangladesh's left-arm spinner Taijul Islam removed New Zealand opener Tom Latham to give his side the first breakthrough on Day Two of the first Test against New Zealand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. Latham , who scored 21, scooped one up to short fine leg while trying to sweep Taijul in the 13th over of the innings. New Zealand were one down for 36 after 13 overs, with Devon Conway unbeaten on 11 at the crease where he was joined by Kane Williamson following Latham's dismissal. Bangladesh all out for 310 Bangladesh failed to add any run to their overnight total as they were all out for 310 on Day Two of the first Test against New Zealand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. Shoriful Islam was the last wicket to go as he was trapped lbw on the very first delivery of the morning session bowled by Kiwi skipper Tim Southee. The last pair managed to add a 20-run stand before Bangladesh got skittled out, with Shoriful adding 13 runs while Taijul managed eight. Bangladesh opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy top-scored with 86 after the hosts decided to bat first having won the toss.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Mitchell completes fifty, Bangladesh search for final three wickets Overnight batsman Daryl Mitchell reached his half-century in the second over of the fifth and final day of the first Test as Bangladesh are searching for the final three wickets to complete a historic Test win over New Zealand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Mitchell, who resumed the day's play on 44, reached his fifth Test half-century off 99 balls. His partner Ish Sodhi is unbeaten on eight. Taijul Islam and Nayeem Hasan have started the day's proceedings for the hosts. New Zealand require another 212 runs to win the match while the hosts need three wickets to complete their maiden home Test win over the Kiwis. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Experienced West Indies middle-order batter has decided to take a break from the international game after being overlooked for the upcoming ODI series against England. Darren Bravo took to social media to announce his decision to move away from selection for West Indies. The left-handed batter last featured in internationals in February 2022. In an international career that has spanned over 14 years, Bravo has represented West Indies in 200 games. He has scored 3538 Test runs at an average of 36.47 with eight hundreds. In ODIs, he has 3109 runs at an average close to 30, with four tons. He was a prolific performer in the recently concluded List A domestic competition in the West Indies, the Super50 Cup 2023, with 416 runs at an average of 83.2 and a strike rate of 92.03. He scored a century and three fifties. Despite the performances, the batter missed the bus to the England series as the selection panel wanted to give an opportunity to the younger players, with an eye on the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2027. Taking to Instagram, Darren Bravo explained in a post that the decision had given him time to reflect on his future as a cricketer. ""I've taken some time to ponder and wonder what's my next step moving forward as a cricketer,"" Bravo wrote. ""At this point in my career, it's not easy or should I say it takes a lot to continue to find the energy, the passion, commitment, and discipline to be able to perform to the best of my ability and put myself in a position to make my return to international cricket."" ""Without any level [of] communication, I've been left in a very dark place. At the moment, there [are] three teams representing the region in multiple formats/series. That's approximately 40–45 players and if I can't be in any of these teams after competing in our regional tournaments and scoring runs, therefore, they are basically telling me that the writing is on the wall."" However, Bravo made it clear that he wasn't fully done with international cricket just yet. ""I'm not giving up but I believe it's best to step away just for a bit and maybe make some room for a young and upcoming talent. I will end by wishing each and everyone all the very best."" West Indies will take on England in a home white-ball tour consisting of three ODI and five T20Is commencing 3 December. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"New Zealand all-rounder Glenn Phillips was shown using his saliva to shine the ball during the third day's play of the first Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand in Sylhet but didn't receive any penalty for his action. The incident took place before the second ball of the 34th over of the Bangladesh innings when Phillips was bowling to Najmul Hossain Shanto with Mominul Haque at the non-striker's end. Before delivering the ball, the off-spinner was seen on television applying saliva twice on the ball, which violates Law 41.3 of the game, where the use of saliva on cricket ball has been barred since October 1, 2022. For breaking this law, the fielding team could be penalised five runs by the on-field umpires. However, the on-field umpire of the match - Ahsan Raza and Paul Reiffel - seemingly missed the incident as they didn't take any action. After the day's play, Mominul, who made 40, also told the reporters that he too didn't see it happen during the match. The Bangladesh team manager Nafees Iqbal said that he, on behalf of the team, has informed the fourth umpire of the incident. Bangladesh ended the day's play on 212-3, leading by 205 runs. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Despite beginning his international career as a wicketkeeper-batter, Glenn Phillips worked on his off-spin bowling to fit into New Zealand's strong line-up as a batting allrounder, and the transformation appears to be working well. On the opening day of the Sylhet Test on Tuesday, interestingly, it was Phillips who emerged as the most successful bowler with four scalps, surpassing the impact of two world-class spinners in Ish Sodhi and Ajaj Patel. Phillips was aided by the Bangladesh batters who lacked the temperament necessary in the red-ball format. The home side, ending on 310 for nine at stumps, would be disappointed to slip from a position of strength -- 180 for two, near the end of second session. When a well-set Bangladesh skipper, Najmul Hossain Shanto, threw his wicket away after top edging a full toss delivery, bowler Phillips, playing only his second Test, had his hands on his head in amused disbelief. ""I have dreamt of getting my first Test wicket for a long time, but that was not how I thought I would get it,"" Phillips told reporters after the day's play. Phillips feels the Bangladeshi batters' over-aggressive approach towards the fifth bowler provided the opportunity for him to further dismiss Mominul Haque, debutant Shahadat Hossain Dipu, and Nurul Hasan Sohan -- all relatively set at the crease. ""Obviously with someone new that the guys haven't faced before, there's always that element of unknown. Obviously being the fifth bowler, as a batter, I'd look to target myself as well,"" added the all-rounder, who was born in South Africa and moved to New Zealand when he was five years old. ""I think maybe the combination of those two things presented the opportunity to take a few wickets, which was really nice. The pressure was built by everyone all round. I just received the reward."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"While the debate around ""Mankading"" continues unabated, New Zealand's Glenn Phillips showed how to avoid getting run-out at the non-striker's end by taking a sprinter's start position in Saturday's T20 World Cup match against Sri Lanka. Running out a non-striker who has prematurely left the crease even before the ball had been bowled is legal, but some find it against the spirit of the game. Others believe non-strikers stealing ground in search of quick runs deserve to be ""Mankaded"". The practice was named after India's Vinoo Mankad, who dismissed Australia's Bill Brown in a 1947 test in Sydney in similar fashion. During the course of his match-winning hundred in Sydney, Phillips crouched at the non-striker's end like a sprinter on the starting blocks, and ran hard between the wickets. ""I guess the position was to be able to see the bowlers and take off as quick as possible,"" the 25-year-old, who scored 104 of the team's 167, told reporters after their victory. ""From a sprinter's start when you're trying not to be out of the crease as much as possible - there's been a lot going around about Mankads and leaving the crease. ""At the end of the day, it's my responsibility to make sure that I'm in the crease and leave at the right time. ""If the bowler is doing his job, then he has the right to be able to take the bails off. For me to be able to get into that start, that position as quick as possible, it just made sense."" Former West Indies player and commentator Ian Bishop was among those intrigued by Phillips' ingenuity. ""Looks like Glenn Phillips learnt more than a thing or two from playing for the Jamaica Tallawahs in the home of Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake amongst others,"" tweeted Bishop referring to the Jamaican athletes. Phillips was not sure if more batsmen would follow his example. ""Maybe some people will use it. Maybe some people won't,"" he said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"After an engrossing tournament spanning 28 days, England will lock horns with Pakistan in the final of the ICC T20 World Cup at the MCG in Melbourne today, starting from 2pm Bangladesh Standard Time. Securing England's second Twenty20 World Cup title would be a triumph for a team in transition but captain Jos Buttler says more success can be reaped by his seasoned squad. Captain Babar Azam told his rejuvenated Pakistan side on Saturday to ride the wave of four consecutive victories and win the Twenty20 World Cup final. Jos Buttler-inspired England and a Babar Azam-led Pakistan will be squaring off at the iconing Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday, hoping to lift their second T20 World Cup title and keeping an eye on the heavens, wishing for its doors not to open and ruin the title decider. Pakistan, England or rain – who will steal the spotlight? As we head towards the mouth-watering contest, let’s take a gander at some interesting facts and hope the finale lives up to the billing. Jos Buttler used to fantasise about captaining England to cricketing glory when he played with his siblings in their garden as a child. Now the dream is on the cusp of coming true. No matter what happens when Pakistan face England in Sunday's final at the MCG, Shadab Khan has had a Twenty20 World Cup to remember. England pace spearhead Mark Wood said he is unsure if he will recover from a hip injury in time to play in Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final against Pakistan but could throw his name into the hat if skipper Jos Buttler desperately needs him. Captain Babar Azam told his rejuvenated Pakistan side on Saturday to ride the wave of four consecutive victories and win the Twenty20 World Cup final. Skipper Jos Buttler says the emphatic way England crushed India to reach Sunday's Twenty20 World Cup final ""doesn't count for anything"" as they bid to become champions in both white-ball formats. Pakistan have soaked up stories from the landmark 1992 Cricket World Cup final win over England in the lead up to Sunday's Twenty20 decider and hope to share their own tales of triumph in years to come, team mentor Matthew Hayden said on Friday.

"""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote India started the Asia Cup as underdogs, Shoaib Akhtar said, but their transformation during the campaign has now convinced him that “they could be the most dangerous side in the World Cup” ""Sometimes a bit of a kick up the rear end is not the worst thing going into a World Cup,"" Silverwood told reporters. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India’s rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. India kept their best reserved, or, Sri Lanka their worst, for Sunday’s one-sided final of the Asia Cup, a tournament played as a prelude to the World Cup in India next month. All too often ignored in favour of the big name sport stars, cricketing groundstaff who kept the rain-hit Asia Cup running were promised a $50,000 shared bonus by organisers on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India's rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj claimed six wickets including four in one over, as India skittled out Sri Lanka for a paltry 50 in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. India pacer Mohammad Siraj picked up his maiden ODI five-wicket haul to reduce Sri Lanka to 12 runs for the loss of six wickets in the Asia Cup final at the R.Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. Defending champions Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat first against India in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. While Shakib warned after India's triumph that they will be ""a dangerous side in the World Cup"", Chandika labelled it as ""huge"" boost for the Tigers heading into the showpiece event. India will have an eye on extending their record haul while Sri Lanka would want to get level with the Indians when they square off in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Bangladesh all-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz feels that the victory against India in the last Super 4 fixture of the Asia Cup will boost their confidence, going into next month’s World Cup. Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana has been ruled out of the Asia Cup final against India due to an injury, captain Dasun Shanaka confirmed Saturday. Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rahman might not be as mysterious as he was at the beginning of his career but the left-arm paceman managed to achieve a feat he can be happy about against India in Colombo yesterday. Ever since Bangladesh won the 2020 Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, it was expected that a pool of players from that World Cup-winning batch would one day come through for the national side. The consensus was that it would happen sooner rather than later, given the youthful exuberance portrayed by that group of players in that tournament. ""I think we have got a very good team (for the World Cup),"" man of the match Shakib, who scored 80 in Bangladesh’s 265-8, said after the win. ","sports"
"India celebrated the 10-wicket thrashing of Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final as ""a booster shot"" Monday for the one-day World Cup starting on home soil in a fortnight. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj got four wickets in one over to help skittle Sri Lanka out for 50 on Sunday, a total the Indian openers Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill surpassed in 6.1 overs. It was India's eighth Asia Cup crown but first major tournament title since winning the same competition in 2018. ""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote. The India Express called it a ""Booster shot before World Cup"" and praised what it called the team's ""clinical and ruthless"" performance. ""Triumph lifts India's morale... just in time for the mega-event,"" it added, referring to the World Cup, which starts on October 5. In the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, where the final took place, the mood was gloomy. ""Abject surrender of Asia Cup by Sri Lanka,"" said a headline in the daily FT newspaper. The home team were bowled out in just 15.2 overs with Siraj ripping through the Sri Lankan batting with his 6-21. Sri Lanka were playing their 11th Asia Cup final but the 116-minute humiliation left fans disappointed and angry. One fan complained in a video post on social media that Sri Lanka were all out even before he could get to his seat at the 35,000-capacity Premadasa stadium. Another on social media said the Sri Lankan innings lasted less than the time taken to drink a bottle of arak, the island nation's firewater spirit made from fermented coconut or sugarcane. Colombo's Daily Mirror said the final was a ""mismatch between two opponents in completely different weight classes. ""As heavyweights India completely battered, bruised, bloodied and bashed-in Sri Lanka's flyweight batting line-up for an emphatic 10-wicket win."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former skipper Bishan Singh Bedi was a bold and sometimes rash voice in Indian cricket known as much for impetuous commentary on other players as his stellar left-arm spin. Bedi, who died aged 77 on Monday, claimed 266 wickets in 67 Tests, leading the team on 22 occasions after succeeding Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi as captain. His younger peers revered him as a grand statesman of the sport, never shy on offering trenchant opinions on issues plaguing the game, or backing other cricketers. ""Critics would call Bishan a rebel. Wrong. To me, he was a cricketer who knew his rights well,"" former captain Kapil Dev wrote in a book on Bedi. ""He stood up for the cricketers, fighting for better match fees, travel facilities and accommodation... (He) made Indian cricket immensely proud."" But he could also be harsh in his pronouncements, and during his short stint as India coach he reportedly threatened to dump the team in the Pacific Ocean while returning from a humiliating loss to Australia in 1990. He said the comment had been misreported and insisted he would not have stopped any player who wanted to jump into the sea out of shame. During England's tour of India in 1976-77, Bedi accused bowler John Lever of using petroleum jelly to polish the ball illegally -- a charge later dismissed. He was also the first captain to concede an international match in 1978, during a 50-over clash with Pakistan, when umpires declined to call a wide after four successive bouncers by Sarfraz Nawaz. Bedi was born in Amritsar, the spiritual home of his Sikh faith, the youngest of 13 children. He was the most prolific of the spin quartet at the forefront of India's bowling attack through the 1960s and 70s, alongside Erapalli Prasanna, Srinivas Venkataraghavan and Bhagwath Chandrasekhar. Dedication to his craft occasionally manifested as criticism of the spin generation that succeeded him, and he once accused Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan -- whose 800 Test wickets are a world record -- of throwing. ""If Murali doesn't chuck, then show me how to bowl. How can you call it bowling?"" he said. ""He has no follow-through and he makes no use of his shoulders. He looks like a good javelin thrower."" After his playing career ended, Bedi's year-long stint as India coach earned him praise for his tutelage from the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who was in his teens and just beginning his international career. ""I had the privilege of facing him in the nets... and I had to be at my absolute best while facing him,"" Tendulkar said. But his short time at the helm of state team Jammu and Kashmir was marred by acrimony, with players accusing him of bias. He is survived by two sons and two daughters -- a pair each from his two marriages. His younger son Angad is married to Neha Dhupia, an actress and model crowned Miss India in 2002. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Captain Pat Cummins said Tuesday that cricketers were ""not robots"" with Australia's Twenty20 team struggling in India straight after their 50-over World Cup triumph. Seven of the Australia squad who won the World Cup remained in India for a five-match T20 series that started four days after the November 19 final. A second-string India side won the first two matches and reports in Australia say that six of the seven are now set to return home. The third T20 is later Tuesday. Ben McDermott, Josh Philippe and Chris Green were among reinforcements being sent to relieve the flagging World Cup heroes, the reports said. With a busy home summer of cricket looming, including Test series against Pakistan and the West Indies, Cummins acknowledged the burden on the players, some of whom have been playing in India since September. ""They're humans, they're not robots,"" he told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground. ""Putting everything into a World Cup and then playing a couple of days later -- I probably don't begrudge them if they're not at 100 percent."" The skipper added: ""These are still games for Australia and it's great that these tours do provide opportunities for some of the younger guys, or guys who might not be in the first eleven. ""I think these are important tours and you can get a lot out of them."" Veteran opener David Warner, who was withdrawn from the T20 squad on the eve of the India series, is set to bid farewell to Test cricket after the Pakistan series. Warner's Test spot has been in doubt after a lean run of red-ball form, but the 37-year-old was Australia's leading scorer at the World Cup with 535 runs. Cummins said Warner was ""hitting the ball beautifully at the moment"". ""He wasn't just playing for himself out there, he would go and take the game on, be really brave and really take it to the opposition,"" he said of Warner's displays in India. The first Test against Pakistan starts on December 14 in Perth before the Boxing Day match in Melbourne.

"Australia captain Pat Cummins took two key wickets and effected a crucial run-out on Monday as the Australians defeated Sri Lanka by five wickets to register their first win in India and give the skipper breathing space. Before Monday, Cummins had overseen a six-wicket loss to India, where his team had been bowled out for just 199, and a 134-rout by South Africa, their heaviest defeat at a World Cup. Former Australia captain Michael Clarke had claimed after two defeats that 30-year-old Cummins was to be left out of the team. ""I heard last night that Pat Cummins is not going to be selected for this game,"" Clarke told Sky Sports Radio's Big Sports Breakfast in Australia. ""If Pat Cummins is going to get dropped and not captain the team, then you guys have selected the wrong captain."" However, Cummins put his critics in their place in Lucknow, dismissing both Sri Lanka openers Pathum Nissanka (61) and Kusal Perera (78) after they had put on 125 for the first wicket. ""The outside noise doesn't bother us too much. We know what we can do as a squad,"" said Cummins after his team defeated Sri Lanka.

"A World Cup that started with questions over the future of 50-over one-day internationals ended with doubts still being expressed about their worth outside the context of a showpiece event. Australia's six-wicket win over India in front of a 92,000 crowd at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium may have been a disappointingly one-sided final for home and neutral fans. But the memory of several more dramatic contests earlier in the tournament was still vivid, with Afghanistan overwhelming defending champions England by 69 runs and non-Test nation the Netherlands defeating eventual semi-finalists South Africa. One of the plus points of an ODI is that it allows a team to stage the kind of epic comeback more often associated with a Test match, while still producing a result in a day. And while the high velocity, smash-and-grab Twenty20 game may be increasingly important to the finances of players and national boards alike, as evidenced by the lucrative Indian Premier League, it rarely produces drama to compete with cricket's longer formats. Nowhere was this more evident at this World Cup than during Australia's remarkable pool play victory over Afghanistan when, on the brink of defeat at 91-7 chasing 292, a staggering double century from Glenn Maxwell secured an extraordinary three-wicket win. Pat Cummins, who kept Maxwell company during an unbroken stand of 202 in that memorable match at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, admitted to mixed emotions after leading Australia to a record-extending sixth World Cup title. ""It's hard to say. Maybe because we won, but I did fall in love with ODI again this World Cup,"" said fast bowler Cummins, who took a superb 2-34 from his maximum 10 overs as Australia held India to a modest total of 240 all out. Australia briefly wobbled at 47-3 in reply before Travis Head's 137 and the opener's partnership of 192 with Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out) took Cummins's side to victory with seven overs to spare. ""I think the scenario where every game really matters, it does make it a bit different to just a bilateral (ODI),"" said Cummins after a win that ended a run of three straight World Cups titles for a host nation following 2011, 2015 and 2019 triumphs for India, Australia and England respectively. This was Australia's eighth appearance in a World Cup final, having been involved in the inaugural 1975 showpiece game, losing to the West Indies in a celebrated clash at Lord's. ""The World Cup's got such rich history, I'm sure it's going to be around for a long time,"" said the 30-year-old Cummins, with the next edition scheduled for 2027 in southern Africa. ""There's so many wonderful games, so many wonderful stories within this last couple of months. So, I think there's definitely a place (for it)."" But the issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""We believe strongly that ODIs should be World Cups only,"" he told ESPNcricinfo. ""They're not filling grounds in a lot of countries. And there is a power at the moment to T20 cricket that is almost supernatural."" He added, ""In a free market, the most money wins."" But former Hampshire captain Nicholas was a television broadcaster at a World Cup where he commentated admiringly on both Afghanistan and the Netherlands. And without bilateral ODIs between tournaments such as the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, to be next played in Pakistan in 2025, how will those teams maintain their standard or become even better at 50-over cricket? আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Australia's World Cup winners have been denied a full-scale heroes' welcome home by a packed cricket schedule that sees them face India on Thursday at the start of a Twenty20 series, four days after meeting in the one-day final. The stunning six-wicket victory on Sunday, against previously unbeaten India in front of nearly 100,000 partisan fans in Ahmedabad, saw Australia lift the ODI World Cup for the sixth time. But celebrations had to be scaled back by the demands of the international cricket calendar. Seven members of the triumphant ODI squad will remain for the five-match T20 series including Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith and Travis Head, who scored a century in the final. That meant a low-key return for the rest of the one-day squad as they flew home in dribs and drabs, with smiling skipper Pat Cummins among those landing in Australia on Wednesday. It was a far cry from some of the raucous ticker-tape parades enjoyed by victorious Australian cricket teams of yesteryear. ""We've all split off our own different ways, there's T20s coming up, some guys are on aeroplanes at the moment getting home as well,"" wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey told reporters on arrival home in Adelaide. He added: ""It's probably pretty odd scheduling now that you look at it, to win a World Cup and a few days later you're playing again."" India have named an almost completely different squad for the series, which starts in Visakhapatnam and then goes to four different venues, concluding in Bengaluru on December 3. Suryakumar Yadav will captain for the first time, in the absence of Rohit Sharma, and is one of only three players retained from India's World Cup squad. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan was much less diplomatic than Carey about the prospect of India and Australia meeting again so soon. After Australia's veteran opener David Warner withdrew from the series on Tuesday, Vaughan wrote on social media: ""As all the players who won the World Cup should. ""They should have been pulled out to allow them time to recover but importantly get back to Oz to enjoy the celebrations."" Vaughan, who is now a high-profile pundit, was even more forthright last week, calling the series ""complete greed and overkill"". ""Why can't we allow players the chance to have a moment's rest after a WC or whoever wins the chance to celebrate properly for a couple of weeks,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. The World Cup trophy has remained in India and will not be reunited with captain Cummins -- who has this year also guided Australia to win the World Test Championship and retain the Ashes -- until next week, The Age newspaper said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pat Cummins is unsure whether he will continue as Australia's one-day international captain after the World Cup but is looking to return to the Indian Premier League (IPL) next season in preparation for the Twenty20 showpiece. Test skipper Cummins, who will lead Australia into their semi-final against South Africa on Thursday, took on the ODI role with an eye firmly on the World Cup when Aaron Finch retired from the format last year. The paceman said he was ""potentially"" interested in staying on after the tournament but that the decision would rest with coach Andrew McDonald and head selector George Bailey's assessment of his workload and Australia's priorities. ""We've been pretty open, me and Andrew and George around different times in the year you're going to have different priorities,"" Cummins told reporters in Kolkata. ""After here, the focus shifts back to test cricket for a fair while. Probably like we've done in the past, at times white-ball cricket is going to have to shift so we fully focus on test cricket. So yeah, there's no end date in sight. ""I feel like I've been managed really well and looked after, albeit in a really, really busy year where you don't really want to give up any cricket."" The captaincy of the T20 side was vacated when Finch retired from all international cricket in February but Mitch Marsh is favourite to claim that role ahead of the World Cup in the Caribbean and U.S. next June. Cummins is keen to play a full part in that tournament, however, and signalled a return to the IPL next year after skipping it this year because of his busy schedule. ""I feel like I haven't played a heap of T20 cricket and in some ways I feel like I haven't played my best T20 cricket for a little while,"" Cummins added. ""I'm really excited, I'm probably going to go into the IPL auction for next year to try to get some games before that World Cup and push a case to not only make the side but get back to how I feel like I can bowl in T20 cricket."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The match between Northern Warriors and Chennai Braves in the Abu Dhabi T10 League on Saturday was witness to a bizzare and suspicious looking front-foot no ball, sparking speculation among fans on social media. The incident happened in the fifth over of the second innings. In the third ball of the over, Warriors' Indian pacer Abhimanyu Mithun overstepped the bowling crease by almost two feet. The clipping of the delivery is making rounds on social media, with fans stunned and making speculations about the no-ball. Abhimanyu, who has played four Tests and five ODIs for India, was the pick of the bowlers from his side in the match, conceding just 11 runs in his two overs while claiming a couple of wickets. However, he couldn't save his team from a five-run defeat. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Soumya Sarkar's return to the Bangladesh ODI and T20I squad for the upcoming New Zealand tour have raised some eyebrows, but selector Habibul Bashar justified his inclusion saying that the 30-year-old is in decent form and his experience will benefit the team against the Kiwis. The stylish left-hander had failed to make an impact in his comeback in ODIs in September against New Zealand at home right before the World Cup, getting dismissed for a duck in the second ODI. But Soumya's recent performance in the National Cricket League (NCL), where he played six matches and scored 436 runs in eleven innings which included four fifties and also picked up 17 wickets, worked in his favour as he is set to return for the Tigers in the white-ball formats once again. The elegant left-hander has scored three fifties and a hundred in 21 innings against New Zealand across all formats and according to Bashar, Soumya's experience in New Zealand conditions was one of the biggest reasons behind his inclusion in the squad. ""Soumya's form is not too poor as he batted well in the first-class competition. It's not like he batted exceptionally well, but an average of 48 is not that bad even though we expect more from him,"" Bashar told the media in Sylhet on Friday. ""The thought process behind picking him is his experience of playing in such conditions along with his all-round abilities,"" he added. The former Bangladesh captain also stated that the absence of seniors like regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad, was also a reason behind Soumya's call back. ""Look we had to make some forced changes since Mahmudullah and Shakib are not available so we lack experienced cricketers in the team. Touring New Zealand has always been challenging for us, it's a place where we normally struggle. ""When we form a team we take a few other aspects into consideration, not just the performance… On that note, those who are relatively experienced and performed decently get preference,"" he said. When asked whether Soumya' inclusion was mainly because of head Chandika Hathurusingha's insistence, Bashar replied, ""I don't think there should be so much discussion over the coach's input since when we pick a team it's after taking everyone's input. The squad is formed only when everyone agrees. We have our choices and the coach has his. It's not that a player is picked only because he is liked by someone,"" said Bashar. Bangladesh will take part in three ODIs and three T20Is in New Zealand. The Tigers will begin their tour with the first of the three-match ODI series on December 17 in Dunedin. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh selector Habibul Bashar is ""confident"" of seeing Tamim Iqbal fit to play the upcoming white-ball New Zealand series, sandwiched between the Asia Cup and the ICC World Cup, at home in late September. Tamim is currently undergoing rehabilitation after injury forced the opening batter to step down as ODI captain, leading to him getting sidelined from the Asia Cup squad. Bashar considers Tamim's experience invaluable for the Tigers. ""Tamim is working hard and trying a lot to make a comeback. I think he will return before time. I am confident of getting him back in the New Zealand series,"" Habibul told reporters in Mirpur today. ""We need Tamim very much for the World Cup. Tamim's experience, Tamim's performance is very necessary for us to do well,"" added the former Bangladesh captain. Asked about another experienced player, Mahmudullah Riyad, who could not make it into the 17-member side despite many suggesting his experience could have aided the side in such a big tournament, Bashar chose to take a different route this time. ""I think the question has been asked many times before. This question has been cleared many times before. It's good to think about the Asia Cup team we have now and prepare our plans around them."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Hours before coming to the BCB Academy Ground in Mirpur yesterday to partake in an individual practice session, Mahmudullah Riyad had posted a story on his social media accounts. It was his first session since returning from Hajj, a session which garnered the attention of the media as well. The batter had been curiously left out of the squad drawn ahead of the Afghanistan series and later it was known that he had applied for vacation and would join the camp after the Hajj. Before that, he had been dropped from the series against Ireland at Chelmsford as the team management wanted to look at some younger stars. 'Challenge your story,' Mahmudullah's social media post read, perhaps a hint that he was aiming for a fightback. The question being pondered by fans and media alike was whether Mahmudullah wanted to get back into the side for the Asia Cup and the World Cup. Having retired from Tests and having been dropped from the T20I line-up as the management was in favour of preparing the T20I unit with younger players for the future, ODIs remain the veteran's most viable option. Mahmudullah sweated it out at the training session, undertaking a 25-minute running drill followed by a gym session for 15 minutes. He then batted at the academy nets for at least 20 minutes before going through the grind at the indoor nets for about half-an-hour. He, however, did not bowl. A crucial aspect of the current selection scenario is that the team management is looking for a bowling all-rounder at number seven position in the batting order. Whether Mahmudullah would be able to overcome his shoulder issue and contribute as a bowler is exactly what he would need to challenge in his story. A BCB official, on conditions of anonymity, told The Daily Star that all-rounder has not been written off. ""He [Mahmudullah] can of course return but it depends on the management and the selectors' plan. No one can claim he is out of contention,"" the official said. ""He is also a contracted player and one would have to understand the scenario before reaching a conclusion,"" the official added. Rumours are out there that Soumya Sarkar could yet land a place in the Asia Cup and World Cup squad if he can pull off performances. Having struggled immensely to perform with consistency, the left-handed batter struck a ton in the Dhaka Premier League in May this year. He was then included in the Emerging Asia Cup squad in Sri Lanka, where he has bagged five wickets as Bangladesh A confirmed the semifinal berth. Scores of 42 and 48 also see him now challenge for a spot since Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha already said at a press conference during the Afghanistan series that players that would perform in the Emerging Asia Cup 'definitely' had a chance and if someone scores runs, they are putting those names up for selection. Off-spinning all-rounder Shaikh Mahedi, too, has played a few handy knocks down the order while returning decent figures with the ball in Sri Lanka. Star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and ODI vice-captain Liton Das have set sail to play in the Global T20 League in Canada with Shakib's NOC being granted till July 29 and Liton's NOC granted till August 10. Shakib is expected to play the Lankan Premier League as well, which begins on July 30. Mushfiqur Rahim and Taskin Ahmed are expected to return home before the Asia Cup camp, and as the players gear up for a return following their franchise commitments, media eyes would be on Mahmudullah and Soumya, and maybe to some extent of Mahedi, and whether they get into contention for that camp. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chief selector Minhajul Abedin Nannu said that the decision to leave out experienced campaigner Mahmudullah Riyad from the Asia Cup was done after discussing the matter at length with the team management, skipper Shakib Al Hasan and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha. Leading up to the squad announcement for the upcoming continental event, one of the most asked questions was whether there will be a place for veteran Mahmudullah in the squad. The 37-year-old cricketer was ultimately axed, but as per the chief selector, it was done as Mahmudullah did not fit into the plans hatched by the team management for the Asia Cup. ""We had a long discussion regarding Mahmudullah initially. After a long discussion, the team management gave us a plan entailing how they want to approach each teams [in the Asia Cup]. Riyad has been left out after considering all these scenarios,"" Nannu said when he announced the Tigers' 17-member Asia Cup squad today at the BCB headquarters in Mirpur. Even before being named the captain of the ODI side, Shakib had said that fitness would be given priority above anything else when it comes to forming squads. And Shakib was well involved in the decision-making process for the Asia Cup squad. ""We thought the planning that the team management gave was obviously good as they have a plan with the head coach regarding how to go about things with the team. We had a proper discussion about everything. We also discussed it with the skipper [Shakib Al Hasan],"" Nannu added. Mahmudullah was dropped following the ODIs against England at home last March due to poor performances. And with his recent axing from the Asia Cup squad, the 37-year-old, already retired from Tests and T20Is, might be left pondering if he had already played his last game in Bangladesh colours. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma on Wednesday warned they are not up against a ""Mickey Mouse team"" in their World Cup semi-final against Australia amid feverish expectation of reaching their first championship match. The Proteas won seven of their nine league matches to finish second in the 10-team table to book a final-four clash in Kolkata on Thursday. That run included a 134-rout of the Australians at Lucknow four weeks ago. Five-time champions Australia are coming off seven straight wins at the tournament. ""A lot of people believe that this could be the year that we see ourselves in the final,"" Bavuma, who remains doubtful to play the semi-final due his hamstring injury, told reporters. ""We'd like nothing better than that. But we also respect the game of cricket. We're not coming up against a Mickey Mouse team. Australia have a lot of experience and confidence in knockout games like this, so we've got to respect that."" The most shocking World Cup exit for South Africa was their 1999 semi-final loss to Australia after the match in Birmingham ended in a tie and their rivals went through due to a better group finish. Australia also easily came out on top in a 2007 semi-final clash between the teams in the Caribbean. Bavuma said the mindset of his team remains confident ahead of the knockout contest. ""From a skill point of view, from a physical point of view, the guys are quite confident,"" said Bavuma. ""There's a sense of calmness within the team and obviously the normal level of anxiety that you would expect of going into the game tomorrow."" He added: ""But I think we'll take a lot of confidence with our performances up until this point."" Springboks inspiration Bavuma said he will look to play two frontline spinners, Keshav Maharaj and Tabraiz Shamsi at Kolkata's Eden Gardens. ""Obviously, Keshav and Shamsi. We have Aiden (Markram) as well, who also gives us an option there. Then I think it's just finalising in terms of the three seamers, who that may be,"" he said. Maharaj, a left-arm orthodox bowler, has claimed 14 wickets in nine matches while left-arm wrist-spinner Shamsi has seven off just three games. Bavuma also praised wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock for leading the batting charge with his 591 runs, second only to India's Virat Kohli. ""Quinton's been magnificent for us,"" said Bavuma. ""At one point he was the leading World Cup scorer as well. Knowing Quinton, I don't think he's really paying much attention to all of that. I think his focus is on contributing as best as he can for the team."" De Kock, 30, will quit one-day international cricket when this tournament is over. Bavuma said South Africa's cricketers are taking inspiration from the Springboks' second straight Rugby World Cup title last month in their quest for global glory in India. ""I think to a large degree we look at them in awe, the Springboks and how they've gone about their back-to-back wins within the World Cup,"" said Bavuma. ""Obviously, the way they won it this year with the knockout games being quite close and again how that resilience, how that do-or-die attitude came through. ""That's what we've been speaking about as a team that when the crunch moment comes, when the pressure moments come, we come together as a team and we find a way to get over the line."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Australia head into Thursday's World Cup semi-final against South Africa with the same excitement in the dressing room that propelled them to their maiden triumph in the T20 World Cup in 2021, Glenn Maxwell said. Maxwell was part of Aaron Finch's groundbreaking squad in the United Arab Emirates in 2021 and scored an unbeaten 28 in the final against New Zealand. Coming off an incredible match-winning double-century against Afghanistan last week, the mercurial all-rounder said his team had a huge boost from the victory over the South Asian side and were well-placed to carry on and claim a record-extending sixth ODI World Cup title. ""The excitement of that match has given us a whole new belief going forward,"" Maxwell said in an interview with Australian broadcaster Fox Sports. ""It reminded me of the T20 World Cup in 2021. The same sort of feeling. ""The feeling around the group was energetic, electric, exciting and everyone felt they were heading towards the same end goal. ""And who knows, it could be the same thing here."" Having battled a full body cramp when batting against Afghanistan, Maxwell guided Australia to victory with an unbeaten 201 off 128 balls, relying mostly on his hands and reflexes to smash the bowlers around the ground. The knock was quickly branded the greatest ODI innings of all-time by a slew of former players and pundits. With five runs left to win and to bring up Australia's first double-century in ODIs, Maxwell said he was absolutely certain that he would score a six off spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman to achieve both targets. He duly clobbered Mujeeb over the deep midwicket fence, his third six of the over. ""It may sound arrogant and over-confident but (it was) because I knew I had the short boundary, because I knew Mujeeb,"" he said. ""We've played against and with each other. I've spent a whole IPL training with him, having little contests and spending a lot of time with him. ""And I'd faced most of his overs he'd bowled at that stage. I just felt like, 'I've got this ... I know I don't have to hit it out of the middle to get a six'."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Glenn Maxwell said his entire body was in pain and that he almost retired during an epic match-winning double century for Australia at the 50-overs World Cup, hailed Wednesday as the greatest one-day knock of all time. The mercurial Australian smacked a remarkable 201 not out as his team successfully chased 292 for victory over Afghanistan in Mumbai on Tuesday. It was only the third double hundred in World Cup history and the first in a run chase. But it came at a price, with Maxwell riddled by severe cramps. He collapsed in agony at one stage, barely able to walk as he limped between the wickets. Maxwell admitted discussing with Australian physio Nick Jones whether he should retire after his body gave up and he sank to the ground while on 147 and with 55 runs still needed to win.  But with a place in the World Cup semi-finals at stake and Maxwell leading the recovery after Australia had slumped to 91-7, he defied the discomfort. ""It was a strange one, because I was cramping in one of my toes, which was sort of going up the front of my shin. And then as I set off to try and get down the other end, I cramped in that calf as well,"" he told Australian media. ""So I was cramping both sides of my lower leg. And as I went 'Oh no, I'm cramping,' I cramped in my left hamstring at the same time. So I was like, 'I've got both legs.' And then I had a back spasm when I hit the ground. ""So I was just like full body just in pain."" 'Loves playing for Australia' Jones suggested he should retire, but Maxwell was having none of it after being told the chances of being able to return after treatment, if needed, were not good. ""We talked about coming off, trying to get some work into my back and trying to loosen up my legs a little bit,"" said the 35-year-old, who missed Australia's previous match due to a concussion after falling off a golf cart. ""Jonesy, the physio, said it would be really hard for me to come back down the stairs after that.  ""We just came up with 'let's stay at the same end' for as long as you can until you feel like you can walk to the other end or if there's an easy single here and there."" Maxwell went on to compile the highest-ever ODI score by an Australian in a 202-run eighth-wicket stand with captain Pat Cummins, who contributed just 12 in the partnership. Cummins called it the ""greatest ODI innings that has ever happened"", sealing Australia's spot in the last four. ""We were just chatting about it, all the players, and we've decided it's one of those days where you just go, 'I was there in the stadium the day Glenn Maxwell chased down that total by himself',"" Cummins told cricket.com.au. ""He was cramping, but I think you saw out there how much he loves playing for Australia."" The sentiment was shared by some of the world's cricketing greats, who were also left stunned. ""From Max pressure to Max performance! This has been the best ODI knock I've seen in my life,"" Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar said on X, formerly Twitter, while ex-India coach Ravi Shastri called it ""stunning"". England's Ben Stokes simply said: ""My goodness Maxi"", while former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop hailed it as a reminder of ""the intrinsic beauty, unpredictability and inspiring drama of this wonderful game"". আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director Akram Khan feels that the 'battle of words' right before the World Cup was the main reason behind the team's abysmal performance in the showpiece event in India. ""The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That's why we as a nation didn't perform well,"" Akram told the media in Mirpur today. ""The players need to go and perform on the field. We couldn't do that. We were busy talking about off the field topics. Everyone needs to realise that,"" he added. The Tigers had a disappointing showing in the World Cup in India, losing seven out of their nine matches to finish eighth in the 10-team competition. The Bangladesh team went through a change in captaincy a little over a month before the World Cup when Tamim Iqbal stepped down and Shakib Al Hasan stepped up as the skipper. The drama only increased when Tamim got axed from the World Cup squad for being unfit. The opener refuted that claim in a video posted on social media, which was then countered by Shakib in a pre-recorded interview, where he labelled Tamim's action as 'childish'. The chaos in the buildup evidently didn't help the team's cause in the World Cup. Without naming anyone in particular, Akram said that clashes between individuals handicapped Bangladesh in the tournament. ""This country belongs to all of us. If Bangladesh do well, all of us will feel happy. But if some people only do things as they wish, then this will not happen. ""I've always noticed that during major tournaments we talk too much about things which aren't related to the game. That puts everyone under pressure. He was also critical of the experiments made to the squad by the team management in the matches leading up to the World Cup. ""I had said this before, the Asia Cup could've been the ideal tournament for the players who will take part in the World Cup. But we experimented with the team in that tournament and eventually couldn't form a stable unit.

"Australia's World Cup winning campaign in India was an against-the-odds triumph. Pat Cummins and his men stunned favourites India in the final to take the Aussies to the top of the cricketing world for the sixth time. The Australian team's clarity of thought helped them recover from a sluggish start to the tournament and the several gutsy calls they took during the competition set them on course for triumph. Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia's World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- Carrying an injured Travis Head The first bold call of Australia's triumphant World Cup campaign was at best a surprise, and at worst derided as 'desperate'. When a searing Gerald Coetzee bouncer broke Travis Head's hand three weeks out from the tournament, it was considered a huge blow to Australia's chances given the potent opening partnership Head had formed with David Warner.  But while many, including Cummins, began to consider who would replace the left-hander, McDonald had other ideas. ""We thought his World Cup was straight over,"" Cummins explained after the final. ""It wasn't until about the next night afterwards where 'Ronnie' (McDonald) came up to me. He's like, 'I haven't slept all last night – I think we're going to keep him. We're going to take the risk – if we're going to make the finals and we want to win the World Cup I think he needs to be there for the finals'. ""It was his idea and great work by the medical team. That was a big risk. I think we could have been made to look really silly if that didn't pay off, but you've got to take those risks to win a tournament."" The risk paid off – in spades. Selecting Marnus Labuschagne Such was Marnus Labuschagne's standing in selectors' minds prior to the World Cup, the Test star was not only initially out-of-mind for Australia's final squad of 15 but was also left out of an extended 18-man group selected prior to the tournament. The fact that, from this snub onwards, he played 19 games consecutive games up to and including the World Cup final where he played a crucial role in Australia's victory, is nothing short of incredible. The 'bold' aspect of the call comes from the doubts many had in naming Labuschagne and Steve Smith – batters with strike rates of 83.1 and 87.3 respectively – in the same XI. However, on increasingly difficult wickets in India he was viewed as a crucial middle-order 'banker' who could absorb pressure at the right times. Elevating Josh Inglis early The decision to drop wicketkeeper Alex Carey just one game into the World Cup campaign was immediately contentious. After a string of low scores leading into the tournament, before a duck against India in Australia's opening match, the selectors opted for immediate change, picking Josh Inglis for the second match against South Africa. And the move paid off. Inglis' glovework was tidy throughout the entire campaign, culminating in five catches against India on Sunday – a World Cup final record. Perhaps more notably, he made crucial contributions with the bat including a half-century against Sri Lanka in an early crunch clash, and a nerveless 28 under huge pressure against South Africa in the semi-final. Heaping responsibility on Glenn Maxwell The decision to leave Ashton Agar out of Australia's 15-man World Cup squad allowed selectors to pick Labuschagne, however it placed enormous pressure on Glenn Maxwell as Australia's No.1 finger spinner in India. Maxwell was no stranger to being handed responsibility with the ball, having been Australia's No.1 spinner in their 2015 World Cup-winning campaign, however in India this was a different proposition. Three of the eventual semi-finalists each had a specialist finger-spinner; Ravindra Jadeja (India), Mitchell Santner (New Zealand) and Keshav Maharaj (South Africa). Australia had batting all-rounder Maxwell. And when you consider he had hardly bowled throughout 2023 owing to his recovery from a broken leg suffered in November 2022, it was a significant role to throw his way. But the Aussies backed in Maxwell from the outset. And he repaid their faith, finishing as the most economical (4.81 runs per over) of the team's frontline bowlers. Bowling first in the final Finally, the gutsiest call of them all. Pat Cummins knew bowling first in a World Cup final carried enormous risk, and should it backfire could even pit him among former captains whose bad decisions at the toss continue to haunt them to this day. But he did it anyway. Backing his bowlers to fire in the afternoon heat when the Ahmedabad surface was drier, Cummins calculated that batting could become more straightforward during the evening when predicted dew would arrive. And he was proven exactly right, not only prophetic in how the game played out but leading the way himself with the ball (2-34 from 10 overs). আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh scripted their first-ever T20I win against South Africa women’s team on their home soil with a 13-run win at Benoni today. Leg-spinner Shorna Akter was the protagonist of the match for the Tigers, bagging five wickets in a tight match to get Bangladesh the win.

Bangladesh women’s cricket team will take on hosts South Africa in the first of the three-match T20I series, part of the ICC Women's Championship, at the Willowmoore Park in Benoni today. For the last few years, the chatter surrounding the pitch after a home Test for Bangladesh would usually be about its overtly spin-friendly nature or it having nothing on offer for bowlers. When Shakib Al Hasan got ruled out of Bangladesh's home Test series against New Zealand due to injury, the hosts suffered a double blow as they lost their leader and their best all-rounder at the same time. For more reasons than one, the 150-run victory over New Zealand yesterday is bound to be classified as one of the finest triumphs for Bangladesh in the longest format.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. “The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That’s why we as a nation didn’t perform well,” Akram said A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company’s ball. Please, mend your ways.” ICC Head of Events Chris Tetley said the one-day international (ODI) tournament had been a ""great success."" Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia’s World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- “It's a lot better than seeing the World Cup on the couch at home,” said Travis Head as a smile crept across his face. Cricket-obsessed India was left grappling for answers Monday after the team's devastating defeat to Australia in the final of their home World Cup extended a drought in global tournaments. The issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""I think that's been almost faultless, to be honest,” Ponting told Sky Sports after the match. Leading run scorer Virat Kohli — who was named player of the tournament — captain Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and top wicket-taker Mohammed Shami were all included in the team. “It’s tough to watch boys like this,” Dravid told the media after his team’s heartbreaking six-wicket loss to Australia in the final.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents. Pakistan denies this and accuses India of violating the rights of Kashmir's Muslim people, a charge India rejects. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Five key moments from the 2023 Cricket World Cup final on Sunday as Australia defeated India by six wickets: Wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestinian flag, and a T-shirt with the slogan ""Stop Bombing Palestine"", the unnamed young protester ran onto the pitch in the 132,000-seat mega-stadium in India's western city of Ahmedabad. This is the longest boundary-less sequence (off the bat) for any team other than the Netherlands in this World Cup India posted 240 runs after being sent into bat first Drivers honked at fans blocking roads, shouting slogans and bargaining with roadside hawkers hours before the Sunday afternoon finale between the cricket-crazy hosts and the game's traditional powerhouse Australia.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Taijul, who had claimed four wickets in the first innings, hit the final nail on New Zealand's coffin on the day, by getting Ish Sodhi (22) caught at silly point to bowl out the visitors for 181. Taijul took two of the three remaining wickets on the day while Nayeem Hasan claimed the other. Earlier, Bangladesh conceded a seven-run lead in the first innings. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's century and a couple of fifties from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz helped the Tigers set a daunting 332-run target. Bangladesh had New Zealand on the ropes by the end of the fourth day when they reduced them to 113-7. It took the hosts less than 90 minutes in the morning session to complete the victory. With the result, Bangladesh have started the third cycle of the ICC Test Championship with a victory. This is also their second ever win in the competition, the previous one coming in the second cycle against the same opponents in Mount Maunganui in 2021. Bangladesh also take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series with the win. The next Test will be played in Dhaka, starting on December 6.

"Soumya Sarkar's return to the Bangladesh ODI and T20I squad for the upcoming New Zealand tour have raised some eyebrows, but selector Habibul Bashar justified his inclusion saying that the 30-year-old is in decent form and his experience will benefit the team against the Kiwis. The stylish left-hander had failed to make an impact in his comeback in ODIs in September against New Zealand at home right before the World Cup, getting dismissed for a duck in the second ODI. But Soumya's recent performance in the National Cricket League (NCL), where he played six matches and scored 436 runs in eleven innings which included four fifties and also picked up 17 wickets, worked in his favour as he is set to return for the Tigers in the white-ball formats once again. The elegant left-hander has scored three fifties and a hundred in 21 innings against New Zealand across all formats and according to Bashar, Soumya's experience in New Zealand conditions was one of the biggest reasons behind his inclusion in the squad. ""Soumya's form is not too poor as he batted well in the first-class competition. It's not like he batted exceptionally well, but an average of 48 is not that bad even though we expect more from him,"" Bashar told the media in Sylhet on Friday. ""The thought process behind picking him is his experience of playing in such conditions along with his all-round abilities,"" he added. The former Bangladesh captain also stated that the absence of seniors like regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad, was also a reason behind Soumya's call back. ""Look we had to make some forced changes since Mahmudullah and Shakib are not available so we lack experienced cricketers in the team. Touring New Zealand has always been challenging for us, it's a place where we normally struggle. ""When we form a team we take a few other aspects into consideration, not just the performance… On that note, those who are relatively experienced and performed decently get preference,"" he said. When asked whether Soumya' inclusion was mainly because of head Chandika Hathurusingha's insistence, Bashar replied, ""I don't think there should be so much discussion over the coach's input since when we pick a team it's after taking everyone's input. The squad is formed only when everyone agrees. We have our choices and the coach has his. It's not that a player is picked only because he is liked by someone,"" said Bashar. Bangladesh will take part in three ODIs and three T20Is in New Zealand. The Tigers will begin their tour with the first of the three-match ODI series on December 17 in Dunedin. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

""I did not imagine India beating Sri Lanka in this manner. From here on, India could be the most dangerous side in the World Cup, but I am not writing anybody off because teams from the sub-continent are formidable,"" Akhtar said on his YouTube channel. Former Pakistan fast bowler also lauded Sharma for his captaincy. ""Rohit Sharma's captaincy has improved. He and the team management have been making great decisions,"" he said. ""For the last one-and-half to two years, he was a bit lost (Ghuma hua tey), but now he is present and doing great man-management. He is making good decisions.

"""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote India started the Asia Cup as underdogs, Shoaib Akhtar said, but their transformation during the campaign has now convinced him that “they could be the most dangerous side in the World Cup” ""Sometimes a bit of a kick up the rear end is not the worst thing going into a World Cup,"" Silverwood told reporters. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India’s rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. India kept their best reserved, or, Sri Lanka their worst, for Sunday’s one-sided final of the Asia Cup, a tournament played as a prelude to the World Cup in India next month. All too often ignored in favour of the big name sport stars, cricketing groundstaff who kept the rain-hit Asia Cup running were promised a $50,000 shared bonus by organisers on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 6-21 to lead India's rout of Sri Lanka by 10 wickets as they clinched their eighth Asia Cup title on Sunday. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj claimed six wickets including four in one over, as India skittled out Sri Lanka for a paltry 50 in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. India pacer Mohammad Siraj picked up his maiden ODI five-wicket haul to reduce Sri Lanka to 12 runs for the loss of six wickets in the Asia Cup final at the R.Premadasa Stadium on Sunday. Defending champions Sri Lanka won the toss and opted to bat first against India in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. While Shakib warned after India's triumph that they will be ""a dangerous side in the World Cup"", Chandika labelled it as ""huge"" boost for the Tigers heading into the showpiece event. India will have an eye on extending their record haul while Sri Lanka would want to get level with the Indians when they square off in the final of the Asia Cup in Colombo today. Bangladesh all-rounder Mehedi Hasan Miraz feels that the victory against India in the last Super 4 fixture of the Asia Cup will boost their confidence, going into next month’s World Cup. Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana has been ruled out of the Asia Cup final against India due to an injury, captain Dasun Shanaka confirmed Saturday. Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rahman might not be as mysterious as he was at the beginning of his career but the left-arm paceman managed to achieve a feat he can be happy about against India in Colombo yesterday. Ever since Bangladesh won the 2020 Under-19 World Cup in South Africa, it was expected that a pool of players from that World Cup-winning batch would one day come through for the national side. The consensus was that it would happen sooner rather than later, given the youthful exuberance portrayed by that group of players in that tournament. ""I think we have got a very good team (for the World Cup),"" man of the match Shakib, who scored 80 in Bangladesh’s 265-8, said after the win. ","sports"
"India celebrated the 10-wicket thrashing of Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup final as ""a booster shot"" Monday for the one-day World Cup starting on home soil in a fortnight. Pace bowler Mohammed Siraj got four wickets in one over to help skittle Sri Lanka out for 50 on Sunday, a total the Indian openers Ishan Kishan and Shubman Gill surpassed in 6.1 overs. It was India's eighth Asia Cup crown but first major tournament title since winning the same competition in 2018. ""Siraj's dream spell ended India's five-year title drought,"" The Times of India wrote. The India Express called it a ""Booster shot before World Cup"" and praised what it called the team's ""clinical and ruthless"" performance. ""Triumph lifts India's morale... just in time for the mega-event,"" it added, referring to the World Cup, which starts on October 5. In the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, where the final took place, the mood was gloomy. ""Abject surrender of Asia Cup by Sri Lanka,"" said a headline in the daily FT newspaper. The home team were bowled out in just 15.2 overs with Siraj ripping through the Sri Lankan batting with his 6-21. Sri Lanka were playing their 11th Asia Cup final but the 116-minute humiliation left fans disappointed and angry. One fan complained in a video post on social media that Sri Lanka were all out even before he could get to his seat at the 35,000-capacity Premadasa stadium. Another on social media said the Sri Lankan innings lasted less than the time taken to drink a bottle of arak, the island nation's firewater spirit made from fermented coconut or sugarcane. Colombo's Daily Mirror said the final was a ""mismatch between two opponents in completely different weight classes.

"Bangladesh batter Najmul Hossain Shanto has been ruled out of the Asia Cup due to a hamstring injury, Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed on Tuesday. Shanto, who is currently the leading scorer of the Asia Cup with 193 runs in two matches, will return home immediately to begin his rehabilitation. Liton Das, who flew to Lahore last night following recovery from viral fever, will replace Shanto in the squad. ""The player had complained of hamstring pain during batting and could not field. We had an MRI scan done confirming a muscle tear. As a precaution, Shanto will not take any further part in the tournament and will be returning home to start rehab and prepare for the World Cup,"" said national Team Physio Bayjedul Islam Khan.

"Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das -- the two Bangladeshi players who were in the rosters of Kolkata Knight Riders in the last Indian Premier League, did not get into the draft for the upcoming IPL season. However, six other Bangladeshi players -- Mustafizur Rahman, Mahmudullah Riyad, Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud and Mehedi Hasan Miraz got their names in the draft list, which was released on Friday by the IPL Governing Council. Mustafizur, who was released by Delhi Capitals recently ahead of the auction, has been included in the draft at a base price of 2 crore rupees while the five other Bangladeshis were put on a much lower price category.. A total of 1166 players have been put on the draft list, with the auction scheduled to be held in Dubai on November 19. After remaining unpicked in 2022, Shakib was roped in for a second time by KKR for the following season. However, the all-rounder pulled out of the tournament without playing any matches due to personal reasons. Wicketkeeper-batter Liton, on the other hand, made his IPL debut when he got to feature for the KKR in a solitary match in which he scored four runs and missed out on a stumping. Mustafizur, meanwhile, took one wicket in two matches for Delhi Capitals last season at an economy rate of 11.29. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Although Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha admitted the importance of playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the Sri Lankan advocates prioritising playing for the country ahead of the T20 franchise league. Previously, the Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan Papon had stated that the players will only get the No Objection Certificate (NOC) for the IPL only after fulfilling the national duty after Bangladesh Test captain Shakib Al Hasan alongside deputy Liton Das wanted to skip the lone Test against Ireland and the subsequent Ireland tour to take part in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for Kolkata Knight Riders. Hathurusingha, ahead of the three-match T20I series against Ireland, also echoed similar sentiment. ""Definitely, there is no doubt that it will help their skills if they play IPL since it's a high-class tournament. But their first priority is to play for the country,"" Hathurusingha told the media during the pre-match press conference in Chattogramon on Sunday. Based on the BCB's response, chances of Kolkata to receive Shakib and Liton's service from the beginning of the IPL -- slated to begin from March 31 before Kolkata play their first game against Punjab Kings on April 1 in Mohali -- remain slim since Bangladesh are set to play the lone Test against Ireland from April 4 in Mirpur. Apart from Shakib and Liton, Mustafizur will feature for Delhi Capitals in the upcoming edition of IPL and since the left-arm quick is not part of the red-ball contract, the 'cutter master' was expected to get the NOC to play from the beginning. However, the Tigers are scheduled to play a three-match ODI series against hosts Ireland from May 9 to 14, which would result in Mustafizur missing the three IPL games during that period. ""I think Mustafizur Rahman will also play [IPL], so total three players. I think the board's decision is to play for the country first and the board had informed about this before sending their names for the auction. So, it's like that,"" Hathurusingha added. In the current context, Shakib and Liton can be available for a total of five games in two steps while Mustafizur will be available for three games in the IPL.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Bin Mortaza has slammed the Indian Premier League for not fielding Bangladesh players after picking them in the auction at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Thursday. The 39-year-old expressed his disappointment on the issue and pointed out how the IPL franchises can use the fan following of Bangladesh players to their advantage on their social media handles. Mashrafe used the example of Mustafizur Rahman, who was flown to India by Delhi Capitals on a chartered plane. The urgency indicated that the franchise wanted 'The Fizz' in their lineup from the onset but he had to warm the bench for the first three matches before getting an opportunity to play. Mashrafe asserted that Bangladesh players should be included in the lineup, considering their ability and not just to add value to their brand via social media following that the Bangladesh players have often brought to teams like Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Capitals, and of course Kolkata Knight Riders. ""It is very good that one of us (Liton) is playing in the IPL. They flew out our Mustafiz on a chartered plane and didn't play him. There is a lot to it; There is a social media aspect to it and we become excited as well. Bangladesh cricket has a fanbase which they can use. That priority should be given as our players have the ability. If they pick us, they should play us but it doesn't happen. That priority should be given as our players have the ability,"" he told the reporters after his Dhaka Premier League match on Thursday. Mashrafe, who himself played in the inaugural season of the IPL in 2008 for KKR, said that he is not concerned about the IPL and that his thoughts lie with the Bangladesh team. ""I don't have any headaches about the IPL. It does not concern me whether Liton plays or not. The Bangladesh team is my headache. I, you, and everyone will be happy when the Bangladesh team will play well,"" he said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Liton and his wife are expecting the birth of their first child and the cricketer arrived in the country to be with his family for the time being. Liton is expected to head back to India's Pune to join the Tigers before their last World Cup game against Australia although when he will reunite with the team is yet to be confirmed. Liton had previously returned to Bangladesh mid World Cup on November 1 citing family emergency. The opener had then flown back to India on November 3 and reunited with the side at Delhi before the Sri Lanka game. Previously, skipper Shakib Al Hasan too had left the team's periphery during the World Cup to work on his batting although the move later drew criticism. Shakib today was ruled out of the World Cup of the last match against Ausstralia and Anamul Haque Bijoy was named as his replacement.

"Mumbai Indians fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah returned his best Twenty20 figures of 5-10 but his team went down to Kolkata Knight Riders by 52 runs in the IPL on Monday. Venkatesh Iyer (43) and Nitish Rana (43) guided Kolkata to 165 for nine, a total their bowlers defended by bowling out the opposition for 113 at Mumbai's DY Patil Stadium. Australia fast bowler Pat Cummins took three wickets in one over to return figures of 3-22 to help Kolkata move from ninth to seventh in the 10-team table and keep their play-off hopes alive. Five-time champions Mumbai, who were winless for eight matches this season before getting two wins, have already bowed out of final-four contention. Venkatesh gave Kolkata a brisk start as they reached 64-1 in the first six overs after being put into bat first. Venkatesh smashed four sixes in his 24-ball knock but fell short of his fifty after being caught at covers in his attempt to go big again. Rana took on the opposition bowlers in a 26-ball 43 and Kolkata looked like getting past 190 before Bumrah came roaring back in his second over. Bumrah, who had picked up just five wickets in the previous 10 matches, struck twice and followed that with a triple-wicket maiden in his third over. He sent back the big-hitting West Indian big-hitter Andre Russell for nine and had Rana caught behind. He took three wickets in four balls but Tim Southee averted a hat-trick. Rinku Singh hit an unbeaten 23 and denied Bumrah a sixth wicket in the 20th over, playing out five dot balls before taking a single on the final delivery. In reply, Mumbai lost Rohit Sharma for two, caught behind off Southee as Kolkata successfully reviewed the call in their favour after the on-field umpire denied the appeal. Russell struck twice with his pace bowling, but Ishan Kishan attempted to revive the chase in his 43-ball 51. Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took down Tim David for 13 and Cummins struck three times including Kishan and Daniel Sams in one over to turn the tide in Kolkata's favour. Kolkata wrapped up the Mumbai innings in 17.3 overs with three run outs including Kieron Pollard for 15. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Shubman Gill called his 129 on Friday his ""best innings"" in the Indian Premier League after he powered champions Gujarat Titans into the final with a 62-run thrashing of Mumbai Indians. Gill's 60-ball knock -- his third ton in four IPL innings -- fired Gujarat to 233-3, a total they defended by bowling out five-time winners Mumbai for 171 in 18.2 overs in the final playoff which started late due to rain in Ahmedabad. They will play Chennai Super Kings in the final on Sunday at the same venue. Named man of the match, Gill said: ""I think this was probably my best innings so far in the IPL."" Skipper Hardik Pandya praised his opener, saying: ""Today's innings was one of the finest, he never looked rushed. It felt like someone was throwing balls and he was hitting. He will be a superstar in international and franchise cricket."" Gill hit 10 sixes and put on a second-wicket stand of 138 with Sai Sudharsan, who made 43, to tear into the opposition attack at the world's biggest cricket stadium. He became the leading batsman this season with 851 runs, surpassing Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Faf du Plessis (730), before he reached his IPL best and the top score of this season. Fast bowler Mohit Sharma took five wickets for Gujarat, who won last year's crown in a fairytale debut season, after a valiant 61 by Suryakumar Yadav. The 132,000-capacity stadium had over 75,000 fans in attendance to witness the home team triumph. Opener Gill, who is tipped as the future of Indian batting, made the most of a reprieve on 30 when Tim David dropped him off England fast bowler Chris Jordan. Little impact The 23-year-old Gill brought up his fifty in 32 balls and then exploded to smash sixes and reach his hundred in 49 balls, taking a bow amid a standing ovation. He finally fell to Akash Madhwal and Sudharsan retired out before Pandya, who made an unbeaten 13-ball 28, and Rashid Khan finished the innings on a high with 19 runs in the final over. Mumbai's worries increased when wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan was injured after he was caught by the elbow of team-mate Jordan. He was later replaced by concussion substitute Vishnu Vinod. Tilak Varma struck 43 off 14 balls as he smashed Mohammed Shami for four fours and a six in an over but was soon bowled by Rashid's leg spin. Suryakumar attempted to mount the chase in his 38-ball knock and put on a key 51-run stand with Cameron Green, who hit 30 in a stop-start innings after being hit on the elbow by Pandya. Ireland's left-arm quick Josh Little, who came in as an impact sub for Gill after the Gujarat innings, bowled Green. Suryakumar made his fifty in 33 balls but was bowled by Mohit, who struck twice in one over to derail the innings. Rashid trapped David lbw for two and hopes ended for Mumbai, who last won the crown in 2020. ""We had a great performance last game. We have to credit Shubman. I hope he continues that form,"" said skipper Rohit Sharma. M.S.

"All-rounder Hardik Pandya has been ruled out of India's World Cup clash with New Zealand after suffering an injury in the win over Bangladesh, the BCCI said in a statement Friday. Pandya twisted his ankle Thursday just three balls into his stint as first change in the ninth over, after being hit for consecutive boundaries by Liton Das. Following prolonged on-field treatment, he tried running into bowl but could only hobble towards the crease and eventually limped off the field.

"Trent Boult led an inspired bowling display to help New Zealand down Sri Lanka by five wickets on Thursday and move to the brink of the World Cup semi-finals. Chasing a modest 172 for victory, New Zealand rode on an opening stand between Devon Conway (45) and Rachin Ravindra (42) to achieve the target with 160 balls to spare in Bengaluru. The Kiwis remain in fourth position with 10 points ahead of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a with much superior net run-rate than their rivals. Both Pakistan and Afghanistan need improbable victory margins in their last matches against England and South Africa respectively to have any of chance of making the final four. ""There's a few teams that could end up on similar points,"" said New Zealand captain Kane Williamson. ""It's out of our control, we have a couple of trainings, a couple of days off, I don't know how it will look but it's great."" The Black Caps, in their last league match, bounced back from four straight losses to close in on a likely semi-final clash against undefeated India. Ravindra, who also took two wickets, added to his blazing form in the tournament including three centuries to edge past South Africa's Quinton de Kock and top the batting chart with 565 runs. Both left-handed openers struck regular boundaries before Dushmantha Chameera broke through with the wicket of Conway and soon Ravindra followed his partner to the pavilion. Williamson fell for 14 and Mark Chapaman was run out but Daryl Mitchell's attacking 43 ensured an easy way home despite his departure 10 runs short of the target. Boult returned figures of 3-37 after the Kiwis elected to field first and bundled out Sri Lanka for 171 in 46.4 overs. Struggles Opener Kusal Perera smashed 51 but the rest of the batting fell apart. Sri Lanka slipped to 128-9 before number nine Maheesh Theekshana (38 not out) and Dilshan Madushanka (19) put on a 43-run 10th-wicket to add some respect to the total. Sri Lanka lost half their side for 70 inside 10 overs after Lockie Ferguson sent back the left-handed Perera, who hit nine fours and two sixes in his 28-ball knock. Perera was dropped on nought by wicketkeeper Tom Latham off Tim Southee who struck with a wicket on the next ball to send back Pathum Nissanka, caught behind for two. Boult then took the wickets of skipper Kusal Mendis (six), Sadeera Samarawickrama (one) and Charith Asalanka (eight), who was given not out but the Kiwis successfully reviewed the decision in their favour. The Mendis strike was Boult's 50th World Cup wicket Cup to enter elite company including Glenn McGrath, Muttiah Muralitharan, Mitchell Starc, Lasith Malinga and Wasim Akram. Leg-spinner Mitchell Santner struck twice with his left-arm spin to claim the key wickets of Angelo Mathews (16) and Dhananjaya de Silva (19). Mathews looked dejected after being caught at slip off Santner's left-arm spin in his first innings after his ""timed out"" dismissal -- the first in international cricket history -- in the team's previous loss to Bangladesh. ""In the first 10 overs we lost too many wickets and that meant we struggled in the middle overs,"" said Mendis. ""If we'd had a good score in the top order we'd have got over 300 and that would be a good score on this pitch.""

"A forecast for rain has added an unknown element to New Zealand's final World Cup group stage match against Sri Lanka in Chennai on Thursday, captain Kane Williamson said. New Zealand occupy the last semi-final slot available but only by virtue of having a better net run rate than Pakistan and Afghanistan, with all three teams tied on eight points after eight games. ""We'll still have to very much see what the pitch is like. There's been a lot of weather around and it could look different tomorrow,"" said Williamson. ""There's lots of things that we can't control and the weather is one of those. There may be a thought in the back of your mind, but at the end of the day, our focus will be on the cricket that we want to play."" New Zealand, finalists in 2019, won their first four matches in India before losing the next four. ""There were also some really close games and ones that we lost,"" Williamson said. ""I think if we look at the cricket on a whole, there has been a lot of good cricket. ""The beauty of this type of layout is that you do play everybody, you are challenged by everybody in different ways, so the focus is much more about your own cricket and how you look to try and handle that."" New Zealand similarly struggled to make the semis in 2019 but were able to turn things around and reach the final. ""I suppose guys have had some of those experiences, but it's another game on another day and four years later,"" Williamson said. ""So, the focus is here and now and on the conditions, and how we want to adjust.""

"India's omission of star Virat Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma from an upcoming Twenty20 series against New Zealand is only intended to give them a rest, coach Rahul Dravid said Monday. The duo's absence from two successive series had stoked rumours that Hardik Pandya would take over as regular T20 captain. Pandya led the team to a 2-1 T20 series win over Sri Lanka earlier this month and has been named captain for the New Zealand matches, starting with Friday's opener. Speaking ahead of the final one-day international against New Zealand on Tuesday, Dravid said India would prioritise the 50-over format going into this year's Cricket World Cup. ""There are certain priorities we need to give to certain white-ball tournaments,"" said Dravid, whose team already have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the ODI series, told reporters in Indore. India host Australia for four Tests starting February 9, followed by three ODI matches. ""So the priority after last year's T20 World Cup has been these six games and Virat has played all these six games and he will get a bit of a break along with Rohit,"" Dravid said, referring to the ODIs against Sri Lanka and New Zeland. Dravid was pressed further on India's plans for a split captaincy in different formats. ""That's a question you need to ask the selectors but as of now, I don't think so,"" the 50-year-old said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India's Virat Kohli struck a record 50th hundred in one-dayers to power the unbeaten hosts to 397 for four wickets against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday. Kohli's knock of 117, which came off 113 balls, gave him the record for the highest number of centuries in the 50-overs format of the game, taking him past Sachin Tendulkar with the Indian batting great present in the stands to applaud. After scampering for two runs off fast bowler Lockie Ferguson to get to his mark, Kohli took off his helmet and bowed to the stands where television cameras showed Tendulkar and former England soccer captain David Beckham standing and clapping in appreciation. The 35-year-old hit nine fours and two sixes before holing out in the deep off fast bowler Tim Southee, who took three wickets for 100. Shreyas Iyer's blistering 105, which came off just 70 balls and was studded with four fours and eight sixes, provided the late fireworks for India's innings. India captain Rohit Sharma, who made 47, won the toss and decided to bat and gave the hosts a rollicking start with a 71-run opening stand with Shubman Gill. Gill retired hurt due to leg cramps but returned later to bat again, remaining unbeaten on 80. The venue, where India won their last 50-overs World Cup title, has hosted four day-night contests so far at this tournament with three of those being won by the team batting first. Australia were the only team to win batting second at the ground after Glenn Maxwell hit an unbeaten double hundred. India have looked invincible so far, winning all nine of their round robin matches including a four-wicket victory over the Black Caps in Dharamsala. New Zealand, however, defeated India at the same stage of the 2019 edition. Australia and South Africa will meet in the second semi-final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens, with the final to be held on Sunday in Ahmedabad. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Australia opener David Warner pulled out from the five-match T20 series against India, starting from Thursday. Warner – Australia's leading run-scorer with 535 at 48.63 during their successful World Cup campaign--will instead return home ahead of his final Test summer having previously stated his plans to retire from the longest format following the New Year's match against Pakistan in Sydney. Emerging West Australian allrounder Aaron Hardie joined the Aussie squad over the weekend as a replacement for Warner after making both his ODI and T20I debuts during the white-ball tour of South Africa in September. ""Selectors decided Warner would return home on the back of a successful yet demanding World Cup campaign,"" Cricket Australia said in a statement. Despite signalling his intention to call time on his Test career, Warner is determined to play on in the white-ball formats, replying to social media post this morning highlighting his ODI World Cup record with: ""Who said I'm finished??"" Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have named an experienced T20 performer as the captain of the team for the five-game T20I series against Australia. Suryakumar Yadav was named as the captain of the side which will take on Australia in the five T20I home series. A majority of the members of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 have been rested after the gruelling tournament and the build-up to it. Only three players – Suryakumar, Prasidh and Ishan Kishan – will play in the upcoming T20I series. The series runs from 23 November to 3 December. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Australia's World Cup winning campaign in India was an against-the-odds triumph. Pat Cummins and his men stunned favourites India in the final to take the Aussies to the top of the cricketing world for the sixth time. The Australian team's clarity of thought helped them recover from a sluggish start to the tournament and the several gutsy calls they took during the competition set them on course for triumph. Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia's World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- Carrying an injured Travis Head The first bold call of Australia's triumphant World Cup campaign was at best a surprise, and at worst derided as 'desperate'. When a searing Gerald Coetzee bouncer broke Travis Head's hand three weeks out from the tournament, it was considered a huge blow to Australia's chances given the potent opening partnership Head had formed with David Warner.  But while many, including Cummins, began to consider who would replace the left-hander, McDonald had other ideas. ""We thought his World Cup was straight over,"" Cummins explained after the final. ""It wasn't until about the next night afterwards where 'Ronnie' (McDonald) came up to me. He's like, 'I haven't slept all last night – I think we're going to keep him. We're going to take the risk – if we're going to make the finals and we want to win the World Cup I think he needs to be there for the finals'. ""It was his idea and great work by the medical team. That was a big risk. I think we could have been made to look really silly if that didn't pay off, but you've got to take those risks to win a tournament."" The risk paid off – in spades. Selecting Marnus Labuschagne Such was Marnus Labuschagne's standing in selectors' minds prior to the World Cup, the Test star was not only initially out-of-mind for Australia's final squad of 15 but was also left out of an extended 18-man group selected prior to the tournament. The fact that, from this snub onwards, he played 19 games consecutive games up to and including the World Cup final where he played a crucial role in Australia's victory, is nothing short of incredible. The 'bold' aspect of the call comes from the doubts many had in naming Labuschagne and Steve Smith – batters with strike rates of 83.1 and 87.3 respectively – in the same XI. However, on increasingly difficult wickets in India he was viewed as a crucial middle-order 'banker' who could absorb pressure at the right times. Elevating Josh Inglis early The decision to drop wicketkeeper Alex Carey just one game into the World Cup campaign was immediately contentious. After a string of low scores leading into the tournament, before a duck against India in Australia's opening match, the selectors opted for immediate change, picking Josh Inglis for the second match against South Africa. And the move paid off. Inglis' glovework was tidy throughout the entire campaign, culminating in five catches against India on Sunday – a World Cup final record. Perhaps more notably, he made crucial contributions with the bat including a half-century against Sri Lanka in an early crunch clash, and a nerveless 28 under huge pressure against South Africa in the semi-final. Heaping responsibility on Glenn Maxwell The decision to leave Ashton Agar out of Australia's 15-man World Cup squad allowed selectors to pick Labuschagne, however it placed enormous pressure on Glenn Maxwell as Australia's No.1 finger spinner in India. Maxwell was no stranger to being handed responsibility with the ball, having been Australia's No.1 spinner in their 2015 World Cup-winning campaign, however in India this was a different proposition. Three of the eventual semi-finalists each had a specialist finger-spinner; Ravindra Jadeja (India), Mitchell Santner (New Zealand) and Keshav Maharaj (South Africa). Australia had batting all-rounder Maxwell. And when you consider he had hardly bowled throughout 2023 owing to his recovery from a broken leg suffered in November 2022, it was a significant role to throw his way. But the Aussies backed in Maxwell from the outset. And he repaid their faith, finishing as the most economical (4.81 runs per over) of the team's frontline bowlers. Bowling first in the final Finally, the gutsiest call of them all. Pat Cummins knew bowling first in a World Cup final carried enormous risk, and should it backfire could even pit him among former captains whose bad decisions at the toss continue to haunt them to this day. But he did it anyway. Backing his bowlers to fire in the afternoon heat when the Ahmedabad surface was drier, Cummins calculated that batting could become more straightforward during the evening when predicted dew would arrive. And he was proven exactly right, not only prophetic in how the game played out but leading the way himself with the ball (2-34 from 10 overs). আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, playing for Hyderabad, bowled relatively economically in Chennai's 182 for three, finishing with none for 32 in his four overs. He also hit a 19-ball 24 with two fours and a six batting at number five. Shakib's first three overs went for just 18 but Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu took 14 runs off his last over. It was Shakib's second wicketless match on the trot, meaning that he remains stranded on 299 T20 wickets. Needing 33 runs in the last two overs, Yusuf Pathan and Rashid Khan blasted a six each off Shardul Thakur in the penultimate over. Hyderabad, requiring 19 off the last over, the composed Bravo was hit for six and a four by Rashid to bring the equation to six off one, but Rashid could only manage a single off another yorker.

"Indian Premier League team owners have bought all six franchises of South Africa's new domestic T20 league, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Wednesday, underlining IPL's expanding global footprint. Reliance Industries Limited, which owns IPL's most successful team Mumbai Indians, bought the Newlands franchise of the league which is scheduled to get underway in January next year. The owners of IPL heavyweight Chennai Super Kings purchased the Johannesburg franchise while JSW Sports, which owns Delhi Capitals, bagged Pretoria. The owners of IPL's Lucknow Super Giants, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals successfully bid for the Durban, Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth) and Paarl franchises respectively. ""This is truly an exciting time for South African cricket; the overwhelming interest shows that the country remains valued in the global cricketing eco-system,"" league commissioner Graeme Smith said in a statement. ""The strong sports background of the respective owners and the global brands they manage ensures that South African cricket and the broader industry will benefit from their expertise and resources, as they bring stability and experience to the league."" ""We have already contracted a number of leading international players who will be announced shortly,"" added the former South Africa captain. Three IPL franchise owners - of Kolkata, Rajasthan and Punjab - also own teams in the Caribbean Premier League. The Kolkata franchise is also involved in the franchise-based Major League Cricket in the United States. NBA player Chris Paul and NFL duo Larry Fitzgerald and Kelvin Beachum invested in the Rajasthan franchise earlier this year.

"M.S. Dhoni was hailed as a superhero Tuesday after the 41-year-old's tactical acumen, cool demeanour and a crucial stumping helped Chennai Super Kings win a record-equalling fifth IPL title. Chennai edged out 2022 champions Gujarat Titans by five wickets in a last-ball thriller that started on Monday and ended past 1:30am Tuesday. Fans of Dhoni and his team celebrated on the streets all night. The final in Ahmedabad was played on the reserve day after a washout on Sunday and, after more wet weather, Chennai chased down a rain-revised target of 171 in 15 overs. Ravindra Jadeja scored 10 runs off the final two balls in front of 80,000 fans at the world's largest cricket stadium. Former India skipper Dhoni, who looks set to play on despite earlier suggestions that this might be his last hurrah, was out first ball in Chennai's reply. But the wicketkeeper-batsman also pulled off a masterful stumping of Gujarat's danger man Shubman Gill and his experience, calm and sheer presence helped see Chennai home. He has now equalled Rohit Sharma's record of five titles as captain -- Rohit for Mumbai Indians -- but pundits believe Dhoni is in a league of his own. ""If you are comparing on titles you have got a discussion,"" former Australia batsman and ex-IPL coach Tom Moody said on ESPNCricinfo. ""But if you are talking about captaincy, there is no grand final."" Former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar agreed, saying: ""This kind of leadership will rarely be seen."" Cool, calm, smart Dhoni is India's most successful Test captain and has had a glittering career that included winning two World Cups. He retired from international duty in 2020 but continued with the IPL, albeit with a bad knee and some lacklustre batting performances this term. Having previously hinted this might be his last IPL, he suggested after the final that he will return for one more crack in 2024. ""The way (fans have) shown their love and affection, I think that's something I need to do for them,"" he said. Rain halted play on Monday as a brief but torrential downpour left one of the side pitches soaked. Ground staff needed over two hours to get the game restarted after midnight. Fans kept patient for the second straight day, with chants of ""Dhoni, Dhoni"" reverberating through the night air, before Jadeja brought the house down with a six and four to seal victory. Videos of ""Captain Cool"" during the nerve-jangling final moments showed him somehow keeping calm -- outwardly at least. It appeared that he closed his eyes for the last ball when Jadeja needed a boundary to win. Dhoni then hugged Jadeja and lifted him off his feet. ""As calm as he is and cool as he is, (still) it means a lot,"" Chennai coach Stephen Fleming told reporters. ""The franchise, as we know, is very dear to his heart and he gives a lot to it. ""This stage of his career to win another IPL and lead a team like he has, I think it is great credit to him,"" Fleming said. Dhoni joined Chennai as captain from the inaugural edition and has previously led them to titles in 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021. ""He is an amazing human being really. The biggest strength he has got is this ability to take pressure off players, particularly young players,"" Chennai batting coach Mike Hussey said.

"Chennai skipper M.S. Dhoni said on Tuesday that he will take time before IPL's December auction to decide on his playing future after he led Super Kings to their 10th final in the T20 tournament. Dhoni might have played his last match at home M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai as the four-time winners beat holders Gujarat Titans by 15 runs in the first play-off. Dhoni, with an injured knee that has limited his ability to run between the wickets, has fuelled speculation by thanking the crowds who have turned up in large numbers home and away this season. ""I don't know, I have eight, nine months to decide,"" Dhoni said when asked by presenter Harsha Bhogle whether the play-off match was his last at home. ""The small auction will be around December, so why to take the headache right now. I have ample time to decide,"" he said. ""I will always be there for CSK whether in playing form or sitting somewhere. I don't really know. But frankly it takes a heavy toll. I have been out of home from January, been practising since March, so we will see."" The 41-year-old has been India's most decorated cricketer and led the national team to two World Cup triumphs including the inaugural T20 event in 2007. At his peak, Dhoni, flourished in the role of an innings finisher. He has carried his batting form and acumen for leadership into the IPL. He has a fan base of millions who fondly call him ""Thala"", or ""leader"" in the Tamil language. The wicketkeeper-batsman has reinvented himself this season as a lower-order batsman coming in at number eight and hitting a few big sixes. Tuesday was a brief farewell. He walked out to a rousing reception at the nearly packed stadium but fell for one after two balls. Dhoni, known as 'Captain Cool', then rallied his team to defend 172 as they dismissed Gujarat for 157. Chennai will meet the winner of the third play-off in the final on Sunday at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon said that he will get to the bottom of the events that led to the team's disastrous showing in the ICC World Cup only after the BPL, following a meeting with Tamim Iqbal at his residence in Gulshan today. ""I told him [Tamim] whatever my decision is I will take it after the BPL,"" Papon told reporters after his meeting with the opener. ""After the election, when the BPL starts, all the players will be here, the coaching staff will also be here. In that time I can collect all information and then take the decision that will benefit our cricket the most,"" said Papon, who is an Awami League candidate in the Kishoreganj-6 constituency in the upcoming national elections. The BCB president met with the former Bangladesh ODI captain face-to-face for the first time since the player was left out of the World Cup squad over fitness concerns. After his omission, Tamim alleged in a video on social media that he had a heated conversation over the phone with a member of the top brass of the BCB which led to his exclusion. Papon informed that Tamim contacted him as he wanted to disclose many internal matters of the team which the BCB president didn't know. The BCB head said that he listened to what Tamim had to say but will make his decision after hearing to all parties. ""I won't act on what anyone else says. I first have to understand what the problem is. I want to get to the bottom of the problem. I will speak with everyone, I will learn about everything then I will take the decision myself,"" he said. Papon, who is in his third term as the BCB president, vowed that he will fix all the problems in the national team before his current term ends and is willing to take tough decisions if necessary. ""I'm not going to be around for much longer. This term is about to end. There is one year to go. Before my term ends, my plan is to fix up the team. I will do whatever is necessary.

"Batsman Shahadat Hossain Dipu makes his Test debut as Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat first against New Zealand in the first Test of the two-match series at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. The Tigers have gone with a spin-heavy attack with Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan and Taijul Islam in the eleven and Shoriful Islam as the lone pacer in the side. Wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan also returns to the Test team and he will be keeping the wickets in the absence of Liton Das, who is currently on leave for family reasons. The visitors, on the other hand, have three spin bowling options in their eleven in Ish Sodhi, Ajaz Patel and part-timer Glenn Philips. Rachin Ravindra, New Zealand's breakout star from the World Cup in India, hasn't been picked for the Test. Both teams will kick-start their campaigns in the 2023-25 cycle of the ICC World Test Championship with the match. Najmul Hossain Shanto is leading Bangladesh in place of injured Shakib Al Hasan. He is the 13th Test skipper of the Tigers. This is also the first Test between the two teams in Bangladesh soil in over a decade.

"Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan returned to the side after missing the two-match T20I series against UAE and the first match of the tri-nation series in New Zealand in Christchurch. The all-rounder, however, had an inauspicious start to proceedings as he lost the coin toss against New Zealand in the third T20I of the series, also involving Pakistan. New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson sent Bangladesh in to bat after winning the toss, saying that he has learned from the decision to bat first on the previous day, which New Zealand lost against Pakistan. Bangladesh, too, had lost their opening match against Pakistan. The Tigers have made three changes to their side with Nasum Ahmed, Sabbir Rahman and Mustafizur Rahman missing out. Shakib, Najmul Hossain Shanto and Shoriful Islam returned to the side. The hosts made one change to their side, with Adam Milne replacing Blair Tickner.

"In the build-up to the first Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand, there was a guile of mystery surrounding what the playing surface at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium would play like. Kiwi skipper Tim Southee, perhaps influenced by the greenish practice pitches in Sylhet, said that he expects to get a 'good surface' on the day before the match. But history of the venue presented a different picture as in the only other Test played at the ground in 2018, spinners claimed a total of 32 wickets in a 151-run win for Zimbabwe against Bangladesh. The Bangladesh team management also knew what to expect beforehand, which was evident from the fact that they had only one pacer in their team sheet and three spinners. From that perspective, the match began perfectly for the Tigers. They won the toss and elected to bat first, hoping to pile up as many runs as possible and put the scoreboard pressure on the visitors. The openers also set the tone -- at least somewhat -- by negotiating the early hint of swing and movement from Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson. Introduced in the seventh over, left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, one of three available spinners in the Kiwi ranks, got the cherry to turn away and induce an outside edge off Mahmudul Hasan Joy in the fourth delivery he bowled -- indicating the turn already available in the surface. But at the end of the day, Bangladesh's accumulation stands at an unimpressive 310 for nine -- a scoreline that only adds to the Tigers' regrets. ""We got dismissed playing rash shots,"" said a remorseful Joy, who missed out on his second Test ton by 14 runs, at the end-of-day press conference yesterday. Joy's dismissal could be credited more to the bowler than to the fault in judgement of the batter -- he was taken at slip off the bowling of leg-spinner Ish Sodhi after a 166-ball 86. But the likes of stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Nurul Hasan Sohan threw away their wickets with ordinary shots. Even a part-time spinner like Glenn Phillips, who before the match had zero Test wickets, claimed a four-for, which only shows how the Tigers curated their own downfall in batting once again. Stands of 53 and 88 at the top of the order -- between Shanto and Joy for the second wicket and Mominul and Joy for the third wicket respectively -- also highlights Bangladesh's failure to capitalise on the advantage of winning the toss and how their batters sullied good starts with poor judgments. ""Our plan was to get to around 350-380. We could not do that. However, we have some quality spinners who can hopefully bundle them [New Zealand] out for a lower total,"" Joy had to hope after a day that could have belonged to the Bangladesh batters. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh 'A' began their tour of the West Indies on a familiar note resembling the national team as the Mohammad Mithun-led side suffered a top order batting collapse against the West Indies 'A' on a shortened opening day of the four-day match in Saint Lucia on Thursday. However, it was the Bangladesh captain who top-scored with an anchoring 42, and remained unbeaten as well, as the visitors scored 135 for six on a day where only 43 overs could be bowled. According to a Caribbean news portal titled Trinidad Express Newspapers, the curtailed overs were down to the long interval used by the ground staff to fix a bowler's run-up area at the Darren Sammy Cricket Ground. West Indies quick Marquino Mindley was the destroyer in chief and scalped the first three wickets. Mahmudul Hasan Joy (0) was caught and bowled while Saif Hassan (20) and Fazle Mahmud (1) nicked to the wicket-keeper and first slip, respectively. Mithun arrived at number five and saw wickets kept falling in regular intervals. Shadman Islam, who was playing a patient knock, was the next to depart after a 46-ball 17 before Zakir Hasan (7) and wicket-keeper Jakir Ali (3) got out for cheap. However, Jakir combined for a 25-run stand before he fell. At the end of the day, Mithun and Co would be happy to have consolidated their innings from a precarious 66 for five after Nayeem Hasan (23 not out) strung a 44-run stand for the seventh wicket with the skipper.

"The concern regarding how to fill the gap when the team's best player misses out on a tour or series is a perennial one. Bangladesh have travelled to Sri Lanka to play a three-match ODI series against the hosts sans star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was granted a break by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) following the World Cup. Bangladesh registered a five-wicket victory against Sri Lanka Board President's XI in their warm-up match at the P Sara Oval in Colombo yesterday. While the team should be boosted by such a win ahead of the series opener on July 26, one other positive takeaway from the match was Mohammad Mithun's sensible 100-ball 91. Mithun batted at the number three position -- where Shakib played throughout the World Cup. And the right-hander did not disappoint, scoring a team high 91 while stitching together two important partnerships -- a 73-run stand for the third-wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim followed by a 96-run fourth-wicket stand with Mahmudullah Riyad -- to guide the Tigers to a comfortable victory. While speaking to reporters after the game, Mithun said that he never let his mind get carried away with the fact that he was batting in Shakib's place but rather just tried to do what came naturally. ""Actually I did not think anything like I am batting at number three position -- the place where Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai bats. As Shakib bhai is not in the squad, someone needs to bat in that position. Normally, it is the responsibility of the players who bat at the top to play long innings and I tried to do that,"" said Mithun. Shakib has been phenomenal recently and was clearly Bangladesh's top performer in the recently concluded World Cup. The all-rounder finished third in the top run-getters' list in the mega event with 606 runs from eight matches. To undertake a series without the ace all-rounder must have hampered the team's balance. However, Mithun's positive display in yesterday's practice match must have given some hope to the team, who are surely looking to find their rhythm after a dismal World Cup. Mithun, however, mentioned that they still need to play their best cricket on the day to start the series on a positive note. ""I played two matches for the A team before coming here. So I think it helped me adjust to the condition as I think the temperature here is a bit less than of Bangladesh. So it helped me but it's not the same for everyone though,"" Mithun said. ""A win is always helpful for a team. Obviously we will be feeling a bit better in terms of confidence but still we need to play our best cricket again on the day -- on July 26 -- if we want to win. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh commenced their World Cup 2023 mission with the first of the two official warm-up games against Sri Lanka in Guwahati on Friday, getting a glimpse of what they are probably going to experience in terms of the pitches and conditions in the tournament proper in India. Mehedi Hasan Miraz led the Tigers in the match today, with regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan having to sit out due to an ankle sprain he picked up during practise the day before. Barring Mustafizur Rahman, all the other four Bangladesh seamers – Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, and Tanzim Hasan Sakib – featured in the game against Sri Lanka, who, unsurprisingly, opted to bat on a flat Guwahati pitch. It is the Tigers' pace attack -- recognised as arguably the best ever the country has ever had -- that is expected to give Bangladesh the edge in the mega event, especially after a great improvement showed by Taskin and Co in recent times. However, the two Lankan openers -- Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka -- sort of provided a glimpse of what might be awaiting the Tigers in the more than a-month-long tournament. Taskin's tight bowling saw the Lankans start a bit slowly but they gained pace soon, making the likes of Shoriful, Mahmud, and young Tanzim face the music in the early stage of the innings. Taskin bowled brilliantly with the new ball, conceding 29 in his seven overs. But Shoriful, Tanzim, and Mahmud remained expensive and more importantly were unable to threaten the batters. Mahmud remained wicketless, conceding 44 runs from his five overs. The right-arm quick, who has been amongst the leading wicket-takers for the Tigers this year, went for 19 runs in the 14th over in which he was smashed for three fours and a six. Shoriful and Tanzim bowed five overs each, conceding 35 and 33 runs, respectively. They scalped a wicket each as well but were unable to make an impact as Sri Lanka, at one point, were flying at 103 for no wicket after just 14 overs. Bangladesh, however, did manage to bounce back -- courtesy of off-spinner Mahedi Hasan's brilliant bowling display. Mahedi, along with Miraz, amped up the pressure on the Lankans with some tight bowling to eventually help the Tigers bundle out Sri Lanka for 263 runs in 491 overs. Mahedi remained the pick of the bowlers for the Tigers, bagging three wickets and giving away 36 runs from his nine overs while stand-in skipper Miraz provided valuable support and remained economical, conceding 32 runs and a solitary wicket to show for in his his ten overs. Bangladesh could take relief from the fact that Mustafizur, if on song, will add to the strength and experience in the Tigers' pace unit from the main group games in the World Cup, but the first warm-up game surely have made the seamers realise that things would be tough for them in the coming days as the sporting tracks in ICC events usually offer assistance to the batters. With the lengthy schedule and constant traveling being the feature of this edition of the World Cup, it will be important for the Tigers' think tank to make sure the pacers get enough time to recover and at the same time adapt to the conditions and pitches. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India captain Rohit Sharma on Saturday praised senior fast bowler Mohammed Shami for a spectacular renaissance at the World Cup after being ignored for the first four matches. The hosts take on Australia in the final in Ahmedabad on Sunday with Shami on top of the tournament bowling chart, taking 23 wickets in six matches. The veteran Shami, 33, came into the side after an injury to all-rounder Hardik Pandya and soon made an impact with a five-wicket haul against New Zealand in Dharamsala. There was no looking back for Shami, who remains India's most experienced fast bowler in a pack which includes Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. He hammered home his importance with a return of 7-57 in the semi-final against New Zealand in Mumbai. ""It was tough for him to not play the initial part of the World Cup, looking at him being one of the senior bowlers for us,"" said Rohit. ""But he was there for the team. He was there to help Siraj, he was there to help Bumrah in whatever way he could. And that shows the quality of him, being the team man that he is."" ""The results are there for everyone to see how he has come back from that. That shows the kind of mental space that Shami had before the World Cup and now."" Shami has claimed 194 wickets in 100 ODIs for India since his debut in 2013. India have lived up to their billing of pre-tournament favourites with a clinical show in all departments of the game. Virat Kohli leads the batting charge with 711 runs; Rohit is in fifth place with 550. But it's the bowlers who have come in for the captain's lavish praise for keeping opposition teams in check in a high-scoring tournament where 300-plus totals have been racked up 25 times in 47 matches. New Zealand are the only team to have scored more than 300 runs against India. That came in the semi-final but the Black Caps still went down by 70 runs. ""The bowlers have done a great job for us in this tournament,"" said Rohit. ""When we started off, we were chasing in the first four or five games and to restrict teams below 300 in Indian conditions was a great effort. It's not been easy. But our seamers and the spinners did that perfectly."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Opener Travis Head hit a sparkling 137 to power Australia to a record-extending sixth World Cup title with a convincing six-wicket win over India in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Chasing a tricky 241 for victory in the final, Australia slipped to 47-3 before the left-handed Head hit his second century of the tournament to steer the team home with seven overs to spare. Head's knock and his marathon stand of 192 with Marnus Labuschagne, unbeaten on 58, ended India's dominant run of 10 unbeaten matches at the event. Head fell after his 120-ball knock laced with 15 fours and four sixes before Glenn Maxwell hit the winning runs to trigger wild celebrations in the Aussie camp. India's chances of ending a global trophy drought since their 2013 Champions Trophy win went up in smoke once Head got going with Labuschagne. Head's century was the seventh in a World Cup final and third by an Australian after Ricky Ponting (140 not out v India in 2003) and Adam Gilchrist (149 v Sri Lanka in 2007). The bowlers set up victory for an Australian side that bounced back after two losses to win nine in a row as Mitchell Starc (3-55) and Pat Cummins (2-34) helped bowl out India for 240. India hit back when Mohammed Shami shared the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah and struck on his second delivery to get David Warner caught behind for seven. But it was Bumrah's double strike in quick succession that raised the roof as he had Mitchell Marsh caught behind for 15 and Steve Smith lbw for four. Head stood firm with Labuschagne for company to thwart the Indian attack despite captain Rohit Sharma rotating his bowlers in a hunt for a breakthrough. Head, who suffered a fractured hand in South Africa in September, was in danger of missing the World Cup but Australia kept him in the squad until he was fit to play. He hit a match-winning century against New Zealand in the team's sixth league game and after a few low scores hit an attacking 62 in his team's nervy three-wicket semi-final win over South Africa in Kolkata. He turned India's nemesis a second time this year after his 163 proved decisive in Australia's World Test Championship triumph at the Oval in June. Head reached his 100 in 95 balls and raised his bat to an applauding Australian dressing room. Head's second ton of the World Cup saw him become the seventh batter and the third from Australia to score a century in a World Cup final after compatriots Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist achieved the feat. Australia elected to field first and the players backed up Cummins' decision with disciplined bowling and impressive fielding. Virat Kohli and KL Rahul hit 54 and 66 respectively after Rohit's attacking 47 but the ball dominated the bat on a slow, dry pitch. Head took a stunning catch while running back from cover point to cut short Rohit's innings off spinner Maxwell. Cummins bowled Kohli, who ended as the leading batsman in tournament with 765 runs, to silence the crowd of 92,453 fans, who like the home team in the middle had an unforgettable day.

Head took 95 balls to reach three figures, putting away 14 fours and a six while putting on a 138-run stand with Marnus Labushagne, who scored an unbeaten 82-ball 41. This took their score to 185 for three after 34 overs.  Head fifty leads Australia chase Australia batter Travis Head smashed a fifty in 58 balls to lead Australia charge as they look to chase down India's 241-run target in the grand finale of the ICC World Cup 2023 in Ahmedabad today. Head put away nine fours and a six for his unbeaten 72-ball 69-run knock and put on a 97-run stand with Marnus Labushagne, who scored an unbeaten 32 off 57 balls, to propel Australia to 144 for the loss of three after 26 overs. Head, Labushagne steady Australia after early wobble Australia batter Travis Head and Marnus Labushagne steadied Australia with a 52-run stand after they were reduced to three down for 47 after seven overs against India in the ICC World Cup final in Ahmedabad today. Head remained unbeaten on a 52-ball 43, with Labushagne not out on 13 runs off 35 balls, propelling Australia to 99 for the loss of three after 19 overs. Smith departs, Australia under pressure Australia lost their third wicket in the seventh over as the experienced Steve Smith got trapped LBW for four by Bumrah. Australia are now 47-3, chasing 241 in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad.  Mitchell Marsh's stay at the middle ended up being a brief one as the right-hander, after making a run-a-ball, 15 got caught behind off Jasprit Bumrah as Australia are now 41-2 after 4.3 overs chasing 241 in the ICC World Cup final in Ahmedabad today. India pacer Mohammed Shami removed Australia opener David Warner in the second over as Australia scored 16 for one in 1.1 overs in reply to 240 runs in the ICC World Cup final in Ahmedabad today.  Australia need 241 to complete hexa Hosts India could only muster 240 runs in their 50 overs as an ice cool Australian team are in the driving seat halfway into the World Cup final in Ahmedabad today. The final Indian wicket fell in the last ball, with Kuldeep Yadav getting run out for 10 while trying to take a second run. India had got off to a flier, thanks to skipper Rohit Sharma's 31-ball 47, reaching 80-2 after the first powerplay. The Australian bowlers then reversed the momentum, conceding just 72 runs in the next 20 overs. After Shreyas Iyer departed as the third batter in the 11th over, Kohli and Rahul, the only half-centurions in the innings, couldn't hit one boundary in the next 97 deliveries. The pressure built up during this period and the fall of wickets in regular successions never allowed India to generate any momentum. Captain Pat Cummins put up a special effort, as it was his spell which killed off India's early momentum. Starc finished as the most successful bowler .with three wickets while Cummins and Hazelwood took a couple of wickets each. The Indian bowling attack now have a uphill task in their hands as the packed stands of the 132000 seater Narendra Modi Stadium hold their breath in wait. Mitchel Starc removed Mohammad Shami (six off 10 balls) and then Adam Zampa trapped Jasprit Bumrah (one off three balls) LBW as India find themselves on 215-8 with five overs to go in the World Cup final against Australia in Ahmedabad today. Shami edged the ball to the keeper while attempting a wild hoick while Zampa struck in his final over of the match by removing Bumrah. Suryakumar Yadav, unbeaten on 14 off 23 balls, is now India's only hope to score a somewhat decent total. Mitchell Starc ended KL Rahul's dogged innings by nicking him off in the 42nd over as India are now six down with 207 runs on the board in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad. Starc came round the wicket and nipped the ball away just enough to induce a faint edge, which the keeper gleefully collected. Rahul's innings ended on 66 off 107 balls where he hit just one four. Australia are now through to India's tail as Suryakumar Yadav, not out on 11, is the only recognised Indian batter at the middle. India's troubles worsened as Ravindra Jadeja departed as the fifth batter of the innings and the hosts have now lost half their side with 178 runs on the board in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad today. Josh Hazelwood returned to the attack in the 36th over and in his first over back induced an outside edge off Jadeja, dismissing him for nine off 22 balls. KL Rahul, who has completed his second half-century in the World Cup, is batting on 55 off 89 balls and has been joined by Suryakumar Yadav. Pat Cummins got the reward for his perseverance, as he managed to make Virat Kohli play on a rising delivery onto his stumps, as hosts India find themselves four down with 148 on the board after 29 overs in the World Cup final in Ahmedabad. Kohli, who had just completed his sixth fifty in this year's tournament, tried to get on top of the short of a length delivery but could only drag the ball onto his stumps. Kohli departs for 54 off 63 balls, finishing the tournament as the highest run-getter with 761 runs. Ravindra Jadeja has joined KL Rahul at the middle, who is batting on 37 off 57 balls. Virat Kohli completed his sixth half-century in the World Cup as India are starving for runs against a charged up Australian attack in the final in Ahmedabad today. After India lost three wickets inside 11 overs, Kohli (50 off 57 balls) and KL Rahul (28 off 59 balls) have opted for caution, using up 94 deliveries to add 54 runs for the fourth wicket till the 26th over. Australian bowlers have not allowed India any breathing space, not conceding a single boundary for 16 overs, and have slowly but surely pulled back the run-rate from over eight to a little over five. India have reached 135-3 after 26 overs. Head brilliance ends Rohit's carnage before Iyer falls Travis Head took a brilliant tumbling catch in the deep as Rohit Sharma's explosive start came to an abrupt end in the final of the World Cup in Ahmedabad today. Rohit, already 47 off 30 deliveries, was going after anything. And he tried to launch Glenn Maxwell but lost his shape, skewed high into the off side where Head took a tumbling catch running back from cover. Soon India were three down for 81 inside 10 overs as Shreyas Iyer nicked one behind the stumps off Pat Cummins. Shubman Gill fell for just four runs as he tried to pull one in front of him against Mitchell Starc as India lost their opening wicket after a flying start. Rohit Sharma had raced to 25 off 19 and Gill, perhaps to complement his captain, went for a big shot but fell to Starc, leaving India 37 for one after five overs. Rohit and Virat Kohli are in the middle as India look to take full advantage of being asked to bat first on a slowing but batting friendly wicket. Australia captain Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to field against India in front of a sell-out crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad today. Both teams are unchanged from their semifinal wins. Cummins, after winning the toss, explained his reason for opting to bowl, saying: ""Looks like a bit of a dry wicket and wanted to bowl first. Dew is one factor and it's quite dewy in the night at this venue."" The decision suited India too, as Rohit Sharma said, ""I would've batted first. Big game and runs on the board. It's going to be amazing. The biggest occasion, in terms of cricketing events. We got to stay nice and calm.""

"Finally, someone from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) stated that they accept responsibility for the team's failure in the ICC World Cup in India. ""We are taking the responsibility,"" BCB's cricket operations committee chairman Jalal Yunus told the reporters today at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. ""We have the responsibility and the board admitted it. We all accepted it. We didn't expect this kind of result. We had a target of reaching the semifinal or winning at least four-five matches if it was not possible then. But we don't know why it did not happen,"" Yunus elaborated. But what course of action would the board set in motion, having taken the responsibility behind the abysmal performance? Yunus, in this case, was not sure. ""At this moment, we don't know the reasons [behind the debacle]. We wanted reports [from team management], and we can only know the real reasons when we get those reports. And we will discuss the reports in the board meeting."" He also hoped that the board meeting would take place near the end of this month. Moreover, the board is unsure of the future plans of the country's two stalwarts—Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal. Shakib had said during a much-talked about interview just before the start of the mega event that he will not continue as a ODI captain for a single day after the event. BCB, however, was waiting for an official confirmation from the all-rounder. ""He didn't inform me of anything officially. As he is injured, we will be able to know about his decision after November 28,"" said Yunus. Asked about Tamim, he added: ""What he told us that he will sit with us on November 22. We need to know his plan."" Yunus, however, said that they have to do everything for Bangladesh cricket after receiving the reports. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan was in no mood to make concessions when he decided to make an appeal to time out Sri Lanka batter Angelo Mathews in his side's three-wicket win over the Lankans at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi on Monday. A horrid run of six straight defeats had left Bangladesh up against the wall, with a qualification for the 2025 Champions Trophy still at stake. The Bangladesh captain defended his decision underlining the fact that he had grounds to make an appeal for a time out as it is within the laws of the game. ""One of our fielders came to me and said that if I appealed, he would be out. The umpire asked me if I was serious. It's in the laws; I don't know if it's right or wrong. I felt like I was at war. Whatever I had to do, I did it. There will be debates. Today that (the time out) helped, I won't deny that!"" Shakib said in the post-match press conference. Shakib appealed to the on-field umpire after Mathews took over two minutes to take guard following the dismissal of Sadeera Samawickrama in the 25th over of the innings. He was unable to secure his helmet strap tightly enough, an action which delayed the resumption of play. The delay was in breach of ICC's Law 40.1 which reads, ""After the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batter, the incoming batter must, unless Time has been called be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready to receive the next ball within 2 minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this requirement is not met, the incoming batter will be out, Timed out."" The appeal for a time out was upheld after on-field umpires Marais Erasmus and Richard Illingworth talked to Shakib and Mathews. Desperate for a win, Shakib went on with the decision as Mathews trudged off in dissent.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Joy scored 100 off 114 deliveries, striking 12 fours and two sixes, while left-hander Zakir Hasan added 62 off 72 deliveries with the help of six fours and two sixes. Soumya Sarkar scored 48 off 42 while Sheikh Mahedi smashed a quick-fire 36 off just 19 balls with six fours and a six. Naim Sheikh once again failed to make an impact after Bangladesh elected to bat. The left-hander departed after scoring 18 off 19 deliveries. Tanzid Hasan (9) and skipper Saif Hasan (4) also departed cheaply as Bangladesh were struggling on 34 for three inside six overs. Joy and Zakir then held the ship and added 117 runs for the fourth-wicket stand. The late launch from Soumya and Mahedi where Bangladesh added 52 runs in the last five overs of the innings.

"New Zealand all-rounder Glenn Phillips was shown using his saliva to shine the ball during the third day's play of the first Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand in Sylhet but didn't receive any penalty for his action. The incident took place before the second ball of the 34th over of the Bangladesh innings when Phillips was bowling to Najmul Hossain Shanto with Mominul Haque at the non-striker's end. Before delivering the ball, the off-spinner was seen on television applying saliva twice on the ball, which violates Law 41.3 of the game, where the use of saliva on cricket ball has been barred since October 1, 2022. For breaking this law, the fielding team could be penalised five runs by the on-field umpires. However, the on-field umpire of the match - Ahsan Raza and Paul Reiffel - seemingly missed the incident as they didn't take any action. After the day's play, Mominul, who made 40, also told the reporters that he too didn't see it happen during the match. The Bangladesh team manager Nafees Iqbal said that he, on behalf of the team, has informed the fourth umpire of the incident. Bangladesh ended the day's play on 212-3, leading by 205 runs. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Mitchell Santner, possessing the experience of playing for the Indian Premier League team Chennai Super Kings, has enough knowledge on how slow bowlers can dictate terms at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, a venue which has a history of being conducive for spin-bowling. Will the New Zealand left-arm spinner make the difference when his side meet Bangladesh in tomorrow's ICC World Cup encounter? Bangladesh vice-captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who came to attend the pre-match press conference today, only disclosed that they have chalked out a plan for Santner. ""He is one of the best spinners I have faced so far. Definitely we have some plans for him,"" said Shanto. When his attention was drawn to the Bangladesh batting line-up, where there are three left-handers who could counter left-arm spin with less difficulty, Shanto responded: ""We are not thinking about it [of having left-handed batters in team]. We are actually looking forward to a good start. We must make a good start. Our four top-order batters must bat for a long time. It will help us if we can do that."" Bangladesh top-order batting, especially the contributions from the opening pair, has long been a big concern for the team. The worries resurfaced in their last match following a heavy defeat against the defending champions, England. Shanto, however, was not willing to talk about their opening issues. ""I think it's better not to think about opening,"" he said with a smile. ""Everybody is trying for the team.

"New Zealand coach Luke Ronchi said Sunday that his side's Cricket World Cup experience in India would help end their barren run in Bangladesh, as they prepare to face the hosts for a two-Test series. New Zealand has largely played on Asian soil this year, with series in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh in various formats, before they played the World Cup in India over October and November. The Kiwis put up a credible show at the tournament, losing to hosts India in the semi-final. ""It's definitely going to help us,"" Ronchi told reporters ahead of Tuesday's match at Sylhet. ""I think if we'd come straight from green wickets in New Zealand to the Bangladesh wickets, it's a big change,"" he added. ""But for the majority of our group here, they have been in India. They've been at the World Cup. ""They have been practising on different surfaces, slower and turning sort of surfaces. So that hopefully helps us for this Test series."" Before travelling to India, New Zealand ended their 15-year wait to win a series in Bangladesh, beating the home side 2-0 in the three-match one-day international series. The Kiwis have not, however, won a Test in Bangladesh since their three-wicket win in Chittagong in 2008. Their next three Tests, including both matches in a 2013 series, ended in a draw. The visitors, who played with just one spinner back in 2013, named a spin-heavy squad for the upcoming series. This time, Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel join Ish Sodhi along with two spin all-rounders, Glenn Phillips and Rachin Ravindra. Ronchi believed spinners from both camps would play a big role. ""The quality of spin and pace in both sides is going to be really high,"" he said. Bangladesh will miss regular captain and experienced spinner Shakib Al Hasan for the series, while pacers Taskin Ahmed and Ebadot Hossain will be out due to injury. Veteran batsman Tamim Iqbal and opener Liton Das are also not available for the series due to injury and a family break respectively. ""It's challenging to lose that much of experience from any team, especially for Bangladesh,"" said coach Chandika Hathurusingha. He said the absences did, however, offer a chance to test other players. ""I think it's exciting, and it's an opportunity for some of the youngsters to make their name,"" he said. The second Test of the series will be held in Dhaka from December 6–10. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India will take on Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final in London in June after Sri Lanka's hopes of edging them out were dashed by a loss to New Zealand in the first Test in Christchurch on Monday. Sri Lanka would have qualified for the WTC final if they had swept New Zealand in their two-match series and Australia denied India victory in the ongoing fourth Test in Ahmedabad. The second WTC final will be played at The Oval from June 7 to 11. New Zealand beat India by eight wickets in the inaugural final in 2021. A Kane Williamson century led New Zealand to a dramatic last-ball, two-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on a rain-disrupted final day in Christchurch on Monday. The only Sri Lankans not guarding the boundary for most of the closing 10 overs were the bowler and wicketkeeper as New Zealand chased down their target of 285, Williamson hitting the winning run to finish on 121 and scupper Sri Lanka's chances of making the World Test Championship final. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former Australia captain Mark Taylor has backed David Warner to play in the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) final against India at The Oval in June and to also feature in the initial stage of the Ashes 2023 in England. Warner has gone through a lean patch in Test cricket since the start of 2021, averaging below 39 and his returns have been ordinary especially in the last two years. Despite scoring a double century (200) in the Melbourne Test in December 2022 against South Africa — his only Test hundred since January 2020 — Warner averaged 30.05 in 11 games last year. In the three Test matches that he played this year, Warner has managed a mere 36 runs at 9.00. Warner, 36, has in the past spoken about retiring from Test cricket in order to push on in the shorter formats, and his participation was considered doubtful for the next red-ball assignments for Australia, especially after his horrendous run in India with the bat. However, former Australia captain and commentator Taylor has backed Warner to make the cut in the squad for the WTC final and the Ashes. Taylor told AAP on Tuesday, ""If I am reading the tea leaves right, it sounds like they will stick with David for the World Test Championship (final) at The Oval. And if that's the way Australia are thinking about the World Test Championship, then yes, they have to start with him for the Ashes."" But despite his recent struggles in red-ball cricket, Warner has delivered in a forgettable campaign for Delhi Capitals in the ongoing Indian Premier League, scoring three half-centuries to make 228 runs in five matches at 45.60. Taylor, who led Australia in 26 wins, 13 losses and 11 draws as captain in 50 Tests, added that he would like to see right-handed opener Cameron Bancroft in the team. ""It would be very hard to have Usman Khawaja and Warner open the batting and then change a week later for the first Test at Edgbaston. My old way of thinking, I always like a right and left-hander combination. So I would love to see Cameron Bancroft get another opportunity at the top of the order,"" Taylor said. ""I see (Matt) Renshaw has been making runs in New Zealand (for Australia A), but Bancroft has made a heap of runs in the Australian summer,"" Taylor added. Taylor also highlighted that due to his ordinary fielding skills, opening batter Marcus Harris might not be preferred. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Tamim Iqbal hit the winning runs to score his 53rd fifty and Bangladesh lived up to favourites tag with a convincing nine-wicket victory in the second ODI against the West Indies at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Wednesday and emphatically sealed the three-match series with a game in hand. The latest encounter was not much of a contest as right from winning toss and opting to bowl first, Tamim and Co never lost control of the game and eventually chased a paltry 109 target with utmost ease, with nine wickets and 176 balls to spare – becoming the largest margin of victory away from home, in terms of balls remaining after a successful chase, surpassing the nine-wicket victory against South Africa in Centurion where the Tigers won with 141 deliveries to spare earlier this year. The Tigers, thus, extended their winning streak against the Windies in the 50-over format to 10 matches and also clinched their fourth bilateral series in a row against the Caribbean side, a much-needed triumph after having conceded the Test and T20I series by 2-0 earlier in the tour. Having romped to a comfortable six-wicket win in the first ODI at the same ground three days ago, the Tigers repeated their act of dominance with the ball in hand earlier in the day. And even though the Windies' last-wicket stand frustrated the visitors again today with a 22-run stand, eventually the hosts were bundled out for 108 in 35 overs – leading to Bangladesh's best bowling performance against a Test-playing nation away from home -- courtesy of some fine display of spin bowling from the likes of player-of-the-match Nasum Ahmed, Mosaddek Hossain Saikat and Mehedi Hasan Miraz, all of whom combined to eight scalps. In reply, Bangladesh only lost the wicket of Najmul Hossain Shanto, out for 20, as skipper Tamim struck seven fours for his 62-ball 50 and with Liton Das completing the formality with a fluent 32 off 27 balls, laced with six boundaries. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon admitted that the issue of Mahmudullah Riyad's T20I captaincy has come up in the media as the captain has been not amongst the runs but opined that changing captaincy at this moment will not bring immediate results. With another series victory overseas, Bangladesh ODI captain Tamim Iqbal took pride for this team as the Tigers whitewashed the West Indies, beating them by four wickets in the final game of the three-match series. Ending months of speculations, Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal announced his retirement from T20Is on Sunday. Courteous and soft-spoken -- Taijul Islam’s demeanor has never been one that gets the spotlight. But the left-armer has been one of the consistent performers for Bangladesh over the years. Bangladesh continued their dominance over the West Indies in the three-match ODI series and once again it was the spinners who paved the way for the Tigers, with left-arm spinner Taijul Islam leading the charge. Nicholas Pooran played a captain's knock as the the West Indies fared much better with the bat compared to the previous two matches in the series but it was Bangladesh's Taijul Islam who stole the spotlight in the dead rubber ODI at the Providence Stadium in Guyana today. The West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran was left a disappointed figure in the middle as rookie batter Kacey Carty threw his wicket away after staging a mini-recovery for the home side in the third and final ODI in Guyana today. Taijul Islam last played for Bangladesh in the ODIs 28 months ago and the experienced campaigner picked up a wicket in the first ball of his spell with a peach of a delivery at the Providence Stadium in Guyana today. Bangladesh have won the toss and elected to bowl first in the third and final ODI of the series against the West Indies at the Providence Stadium in Guyana today. ODI captain Tamim Iqbal had hinted that they needed to test the bench strength by playing players from the squad who did not make the playing eleven yet but head coach Russell Domingo doubted whether the conditions along with the matchups will let them make too many changes heading into the third ODI at Guyana tomorrow. With the series already in the bag and no stakes in the ICC ODI Super League standings for this series, Bangladesh have the perfect opportunity to test their bench strength going into the third and final ODI against West Indies at the Providence Stadium in Guyana tonight. After pulling off consecutive victories in the ongoing tour with a nine-wicket win against the West Indies in Guyana to seal the three-match ODI series with a game in hand on Wednesday, Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal has put serious emphasis on testing the squad depth in the dead rubber, slated for July 16. “Everyone wanted to win,” Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal said after his side pulled off an emphatic nine-wicket victory against the West Indies at the Providence Stadium in Guyana to seal the three-match with a game in hand on Wednesday. When Tamim Iqbal replaced Mashrafe Bin Mortaza as the ODI captain of Bangladesh back in 2020, there were concerns whether the Tigers would be able to continue on the upward trajectory in their preferred format under new leadership. Bangladesh continued their dominance over the West Indies in ODIs as the Tamim Iqbal-led side registered a comprehensive nine-wicket victory to clinch the three-match series 2-0 with a game in hand at the Providence Stadium in Guyana yesterday. Tamim Iqbal hit the winning runs to score his 53rd fifty and Bangladesh lived up to favourites tag with a convincing nine-wicket victory in the second ODI against the West Indies at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Wednesday and emphatically sealed the three-match series with a game in hand. Chasing a meagre 109 target, Bangladesh openers have made batting look easy on a pitch where the visitors’ spinners wreaked havoc against the West Indies in the first innings in the second ODI of the three-match series at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on Wednesday. Hosts West Indies struggled immensely against Bangladesh’s spin and were bundled out for 108 runs in the second ODI at Guyana today. Bangladesh, already leading the series 1-0, will look to pick up another comfortable victory and clinch yet another ODI series in West Indies following their exploits in 2018. ","sports"
"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon admitted that the issue of Mahmudullah Riyad's T20I captaincy has come up in the media as the captain has been not amongst the runs but opined that changing captaincy at this moment will not bring immediate results. Bangladesh lost the T20I series 2-0 with the West Indies dominating all three matches, including the first T20I which was washed out by rain. ""We're not certain that bringing a sudden change to the T20I line-up will bring overnight results. We have to think long-term. I think it will at least take a month for us to arrive at a decision,"" Hassan said during a press conference following the board meeting on Sunday. Asked if they were planning to take a decision on Riyad's captaincy, Hassan said: ""The issue is not like that. Let the team and captain return home first, then we will have a discussion."" Asked if the board was happy with Riyad's captaincy, Hasan was not ready to divulge too much. Former Test captain Mominul Haque had to let go off captaincy after he struggled to score runs during a lean patch. ""This is a difficult question. The thing is not like that. Actually, we were never dissatisfied with Mominul's [Haque] captaincy either. He wasn't scoring runs and that's why change was made but as a captain we did not find any problems [with Mominul]. Mahmudullah's question has been asked because he has not been scoring runs. So it's an issue, so let's see what he says regarding it,"" the BCB president said. ""I think when he starts scoring, everything will be alright. Australia [T20 World Cup] is a difficult assignment and difficult for any captain. We don't believe bringing changes to captaincy will bring overnight changes. ""We can't bring overnight changes even inside three months since the team is playing frequently. There is not much break and these are important issues.

"Hasan Mahmud had a close shave with injury when batter Najmul Hossain Shanto hit one back at the bowler as Bangladesh began training today in Sylhet. Hasan, who could make his Test debut in the upcoming New Zealand series, was down holding his arm but recovered later to bowl at the nets again. Nevertheless, before the away tour of New Zealand which will feature three ODIs and three T20Is, the Tigers have a few absentees and injury concerns. Taskin Ahmed will be undergoing a long rehab process that would all but put him out of contention for the upcoming New Zealand tour and even the Bangladesh Premier League. Given the impact of surgery on pacers in the past, BCB medical team has prescribed rest for the initial stages of recovery. ""We have asked him to completely put off bowling for four weeks. After four weeks we will assess him and take the next decision. Our aim is that he comes back with full fitness. We will take whatever time is necessary,"" BCB chief physician Dr. Debashish Chowdhury told the media yesterday. Taskin had been set two weeks of complete rest since the last World Cup game against Australia in Pune. His two weeks of complete rest will end on November 25, but the road to recovery will be long despite the fact that he is still able to bowl through the injury. ""There is no alternative to long-term rehab since it's a recurring injury,"" Debashish added. Meanwhile, ODI captain Shakib Al Hasan remains doubtful for the upcoming New Zealand tour. Shakib, who was ruled out of the World Cup with a fractured finger, will undergo an X-ray after three weeks since the injury happened on November 6. ""During the review time if we feel that it will be possible [to play] for him [Shakib], then of course we will allow him. But it's too early to comment on what his condition will be after two weeks. But we want a long period of time where he can be pain free and in a rehabilitation process. Shakib's pain has reduced from the high intensity pain he was feeling earlier,"" he said. There is a question mark over who will take the reigns of the ODI and T20I sides if Shakib remains unavailable, with cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus informing that no discussion has yet taken place. Yunus further informed that talks with Tamim Iqbal have not begun yet but the opener is aware of the upcoming meeting with the board. There is also doubt regarding Mahmudullah Riyad's participation for the upcoming tour. Riyad has begun physiotherapy for his shoulder but has been instructed to undergo long-term rehab. Meanwhile, pacer Ebadot Hossain will review his injury recuperation and has an appointment in England on November 30. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"In his first stint as on-field captain in a Test match, Najmul Hossain Shanto was able to leave his mark on yesterday's proceedings, with especially how he rotated the bowlers and changed the field to match his team's ploys against New Zealand batters. Bangladesh would be satisfied with the proceedings at the end of second day, despite letting slip many of the opportunities that were created, having picked up eight wickets to leave the visitors trailing by 44 runs. It appeared Shanto got decisions right from the onset. With just one pacer in Shoriful Islam, he asked Mehedi Miraz to partner Shoriful with the new ball. Operating against two left-handed openers, Miraz began with a slip and a short-leg, an indication that Bangladesh expected things to happen with the new ball. Miraz went on to bowl nine overs on the trot. Shoriful, meanwhile, after an expensive first over, gradually settled in a line in the corridor of uncertainty and troubled Devon Conway to no end with an attacking field in place. Shanto's first-change option in Taijul Islam would reap the reward of early pressure in his first over, getting Tom Latham's wicket with the batter getting a top-edge to short-fine leg. The offensive field settings, unusual for Bangladesh in Tests for long periods, were a feature of the day. Youngster Shahadat Hossain Dipu took a fantastic catch leaping to his right at short-leg to remove Conway off Miraz as the ball took the inside-edge and leaped up. That attacking field-setting did not change altogether even when set batters were at the crease. Shoriful was eventually rewarded in his second spell as he sent back Henry Nicholls to break a sturdy 54-run stand. A heavy leg-side field was also seen when Nayeem Hasan was operating against right-handers. Shanto kept gaps open on the off-side to induce drives and open the gap between bat and pad. Even the usually composed Kane Williamson was forced into an error in the 49th over. With Tea approaching, the right-hander played a sweep-pull to Nayeem Hasan with Taijul positioned at mid-wicket. Taijul would, however, let it slip. Shanto devised another field change, asking Shoriful to come forward a bit further from backward square-leg in the 59th over -- an instruction he did not quite follow. Consequently, in the 71st over, Shoriful was just inches short of taking what would have been an easy catch and Williamson survived Nayeem yet again. Even Mominul Haque rolled his arm to remove Glenn Phillips and break the 78-run stand with Williamson. Taijul later made amends by castling Williamson but not before the batting maestro got his 29th Test ton. Outgoing spin-coach Rangana Herath commended Shanto's captaincy at the end of the day's proceedings. ""He managed well to change up those bowlers. I think he created those angles [making batters play to the field and provide chances],"" Herath said. Shanto's confident demeanour in the pre-match press conference extended to his first day as on-field captain, setting the tone for a collective success in their first assignment of the third ICC World Test Championship cycle. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It took over two weeks for the country's cricket board to finally set in motion a special probe committee to unearth the reasons behind Bangladesh's shambolic ICC ODI World Cup campaign in India. With Enayet Hossain Siraj as the convenor alongside Mahbubul Anam and former captain Akram Khan as its members, the three-person committee will ""scrutinise the factors contributing to the team's underperformance in the tournament"", stated a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) press release yesterday. Bangladesh finished eighth among 10 teams in the tournament, winning only two of their nine matches, falling far off from what the team management aspired prior to the mega event: a maiden semi-finals berth. Akram informed that they will first sit with everyone related to the World Cup squad before filing the report; which, however, has no deadline in place. ""As we have a series going on against New Zealand, everyone is not available. So, I think it will take some time for us to speak with everyone,"" Akram told The Daily Star yesterday. This is not the first time that the Nazmul Hassan-led BCB had attempted to probe into a major event debacle, having previously formed a two-member committee following the T20 World Cup in 2021. The board, however, never revealed any of the findings presented by the duo of Enayet and BCB director Jalal Yunus, now the chairman of cricket operations. ""There were past instances where, despite forming fact-finding committees, there were no significant results witnessed. But this time our board president has strictly instructed us to dig deep and find out the exact reasons behind the World Cup debacle,"" Akram informed further. ""We had huge expectations for this World Cup but we failed miserably. Having witnessed some negative incidents before and during the World Cup, we will take everything into consideration, both on and off-field issues, before filing the final report."" It sparks curiosity that all three members of the investigative committee are BCB directors, involved in various capacities with the board: Enayet is the chairman of the BCB's Working Committee, Mahbubul leads the BCB's Grounds Committee, and former captain Akram is the chairman of the BCB's Facilities Committee. This is unlike what happened following the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, where Bangladesh lost all their games, including one against Canada. The then cricket administration formed a two-member inquiry committee with two individuals not associated with the board: Commodore (retd) Mujibur Rahman and Syed Shamim Ahsan. That report, submitted after talking to all relevant stakeholders, is still considered an exemplary fact-finding report that eventually helped Bangladesh cricket rise from the ashes. Will the three-member committee be able to operate independently, without any external influence from BCB, this time around? Or will the reason(s) for another World Cup disaster be conveniently shrugged under the rug? আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Following Bangladesh's first-ever home Test win over New Zealand on Saturday, the cricketers are expected to receive a bonus for the historic win. Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) cricket operations chairman, Jalal Yunus, informed the media about the possibility of the development after Najmul Hossain Shanto and his troops began their third cycle of the World Tests Championship (WTC) with a 150-run win against the winners of the inaugural WTC. According to Jalal, the win was a ""big achievement"" and a ""much-needed"" one for the Tigers. ""They always have bonus on the tip of their tongue. But definitely it will happen as I have spoken with the BCB president. Once they arrive in Dhaka, he will have dinner with the team and I think there may be an announcement and it's (bonus) going to happen,"" Jalal told the media in Mirpur on Saturday. ""I think it's a big win and, more importantly, we were able to beat New Zealand at home -- which is a big achievement. As you know New Zealand came with their full-strength side. They have covered all the aspects from the pace, spin and batting unit since it's a part of the World Test Championship. From that point, our boys played brilliantly. ""It was a much-needed win for us. To be able to beat a big team like New Zealand is a different feeling,"" he added. The influential board director further said that this win against New Zealand reflects that the Bangladesh Test team has got enough depth in the pipeline. ""This victory demonstrates that we have players in our pipeline, as many have claimed that we lack depth in Test cricket. If you observe, seven of the eleven players were not in the World Cup squad and are mostly Test players, indicating that we have good depth in this format. We also have a few players in the pipeline who will make their Test debut very soon,"" he added. Jalal also emphasised the good team bonding despite the absence of regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan and a few experienced players from the game, and he lauded skipper Shanto's leadership abilities.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"In a World Cup where Bangladesh's performances were mostly predictably poor, their batting order remained unpredictable throughout the tournament. As the number of defeats kept piling on, captain Shakib Al Hasan and coach Chandika Hathurusingha would get asked in every media interaction if not having a set batting order was unsettling the players. And their answer would always be a defiant no. But yesterday, after the team ended their abysmal World Cup campaign with an eight-wicket defeat to Australia in Pune, stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto finally relented and admitted that perhaps the constant experiments with the batting order adversely affected the team. ""To be honest, it is better if we don't [shuffle the batting order],"" Shanto said during the post-match press conference yesterday. Bangladesh had begun the World Cup with a comfortable six-wicket win over Afghanistan in Dharamshala. In that match, promoting Mehedi Hasan Miraz to number three after a wicket fell inside five overs to handle Afghan spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman paid dividends as he hit a half-century which helped Bangladesh complete an easy chase. After that match, the management constantly shifted Miraz's batting position in the order, which forced the other batters bat out of position. Other than openers Liton Das and Tanzid Hasan, every batter - Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, Mahmudullah, Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim - batted in different positions throughout the World Cup. Former players and analysts have blamed this constant shuffling and experimentation by the team management for hampering the confidence of the batters, which is evident from their performances in the competition. After continuous criticism, the team management finally opted for a more conventional batting order in their last two matches in the tournament against Sri Lanka and Australia. Against Sri Lanka, they ended their six-match losing streak by chasing down 280 and while they lost to Australia, they at least managed to post their highest score in the tournament, 306 for 8 in 50 overs. Although Shanto initially tried to justify the shuffling, saying there were no complaints from any of the batters, eventually he accepted. ""But sometimes you have to do it against certain teams, according to their strengths. But I think the less we do it, [the better]. There was a lot of [shuffling] in the World Cup but it was done with a positive intent. If we don't do it at all, even better,"" Shanto said. Shanto, who scored two fifties in the World Cup, also raised the importance of having sporting pitches at home in order to improve Bangladesh's performance in the white ball formats. ""We are not a poor batting unit. We came here well prepared, but we didn't get the result. We want sporting wickets in home ODIs and T20Is. Bowlers will learn how to defend 300 runs on a good wicket. I am sure the board is thinking about these types of wickets."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh's stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said that had openers Liton Das and Najmul Hossain Shanto carried on after completing their half-centuries, their ICC ODI World Cup match against India could've ended differently. The Tigers suffered their third straight defeat in the tournament on Thursday, losing to hosts India by seven wickets at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. The writing was on the wall for Bangladesh after they posted a modest 256-8 against India on a flat track. The Tigers failed to cash in on the rollicking start provided by openers Tanzid and Liton, who formed a 93-run partnership off 14.4 overs - Bangladesh's best ever opening stand in World Cups. Tanzid hit his maiden half-century in ODIs, finishing on 51 off 41 balls, while Liton made 66 off 82 balls. However, in the post-match presentation, Shanto said that had either of the openers carried on and scored a big one, it would've been a 'different ballgame'. ""Tanzid batted really well and all the fast bowlers bowled pretty well. But we did not finish well (with the bat). If Tanzid and Liton could've batted longer, could have been a different ballgame. Hopefully in the next game, our batters can take responsibility,"" Shanto said. Shanto had to stand-in as the skipper against India in place of Shakib Al Hasan, who is recovering from a quad injury. The team management has remained secretive about the seriousness of Shakib's injury, however, Shanto hoped that the all-rounder will be ready to return in Bangladesh's next match in the World Cup, which will be against South Africa on October 24 in Mumbai. ""He (Shakib) is recovering well. I am hoping he can be fit for the next match."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh team reached Kolkata yesterday after their hopes of a semifinals berth in ICC World Cup was all but dashed in Mumbai following a crushing 149-run defeat against South Africa. What could have been a trivial team-arrival story but, courtesy of Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan and the overly cautious team management, it ended up not being a dull affair; in sharp contrast to the Tigers' show over their last four matches. While the team was travelling to Kolkata, the news of Shakib's arrival in Dhaka spread like wildfire. And to add fuel on top, much like how the team management kept concealing Shakib's injury status, no clear update was provided by the relevant authority on the situation. A member of the team management, requesting anonymity, told The Daily Star, ""Honestly I don't know about Shakib and why he had to suddenly leave the team in the middle of the World Cup; that too when we are struggling badly as a unit. ""Being the leader, he should have stayed in order to motivate the players and chalk out the plans for the remaining four matches."" The Bangladesh captain was seen at the home of cricket in Mirpur later in the day, sparking even more curiosity. At the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium's indoor arena, he worked with prominent coach Nazmul Abedeen Fahim – Shakib's mentor during his developmental years at BKSP. Barring the 40 against New Zealand, Shakib's batting in the World Cup so far has been utterly disappointing, as evidenced by his 16 runs tallied in three other games. ""I won't go into the exact details… but we did work on his batting. I think he is willing to get into the groove so we spoke about a few areas on his batting,"" Fahim told The Daily Star yesterday. Mahmudullah Riyad's celebration after his hundred against South Africa on Tuesday, while his team were on the brink of a massive defeat, had garnered mixed reactions aplenty to become the trending topic until Shakib left for Dhaka. Many had hypothesized that Shakib's Dhaka trip was not purely down to cricketing reasons, rather the megastar of Bangladesh cricket may have commercial commitments to fulfil -- in line with his track record -- in the couple of days before Bangladesh take on Netherlands at Kolkata's Eden Gardens stadium on October 28. Fahim said that it was the responsibility of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ""make things clear"" and prevent any room for speculations regarding the matter. More questions were raised as Shakib decided to consult Fahim rather than the national coaching staff. It further raises the question of whether Shakib and his teammates would now simply concentrate on their own accomplishments going forward. Overall, the same old pattern envelops the stories surrounding the Bangladesh team and it would be unwise to expect any clarification from anywhere. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan made familiar promise following his side's another meek surrender in the tri-nation series in New Zealand on Sunday as the all-rounder said the Tigers will keep working to improve their batting. ''Batting is one area we need to improve and will keep on working on it,"" said Shakib after an eight-wicket defeat against New Zealand in their second match of the series in Christchurch. Bangladesh only managed to score 137 for eight, courtesy of a late cameo from wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan Sohan. Bangladesh batting once again failed to find the necessary tempo suited for the shortest format of the game. ""Yes, with the used wicket, the New Zealand spinners bowled well. We started well but we couldn't handle their quality spinners, and we never got any momentum. We have been talking about this, that the top three have to put their hands up and bat till 15-16 overs,"" he added during the post-match presentation. Bangladesh skipper, who missed the first game after arriving late in Christchurch, batted at number seven position to score 16 off 16 balls. Shakib explained the reason behind his decision to come down the order. ""I was supposed to bat up but two spinners were bowling and we wanted to have a left-right combination,"" said the Bangladesh skipper. ""It is hard to keep energy up when you lose two games. But with the World Cup coming up, the next two games will be crucial for us,"" he continued. Black Caps leg-spinner Ish Sodhi became the fifth bowler to take 100 T20I wickets, removing top-scorer Najmul Hossain Shanto (33) in his first over to reach the milestone. Sodhi dismissed Mosaddek Hossain soon afterwards to further halt the Bangladesh's mid-innings momentum, aided by a miserly 2-14 from fellow-spinner Michael Bracewell. Home skipper Kane Williamson praised his spin pair's accuracy. ""We worked hard and pulled it back with the spin, which was huge for us to keep them to a below-par total,"" Williamson said. ""Having no pace on the ball was difficult to play if you hit the right length, and our spinners were outstanding,"" the New Zealand captain added. Devon Conway later showed why he will be New Zealand's key batter at the T20 World Cup by top-scoring in a comfortable win over Bangladesh. Conway batted with control for his unbeaten 70 off 51 balls as the Black Caps chased down 137-8 at the Hagley Oval with 13 balls to spare. So far in the tri-nation tournament, Pakistan lead after the first round of matches, having beaten New Zealand by six wickets and Bangladesh by 21 runs. All three sides are using the week-long series to fine-tune ahead of the World Cup in Australia this month.

"New Zealand have recalled Mitchell Santner, Kyle Jamieson and Rachin Ravindra for this month's two-test series in Bangladesh that kicks off the third cycle of the World Test Championship. Santner, who took 15 wickets at 26 and averaged 52 with the bat this season in the Plunket Shield for Northern Districts, is back in squad for the first time in two years. Santner, who played the last of his 24 tests in 2021 against England, joins Ajaz Patel and Ish Sodhi as frontline spinners in New Zealand's first Test tour of Bangladesh in 10 years. Kyle Jamieson also returns to the squad after back surgery in February in a pace attack which includes captain Tim Southee and Matt Henry, who has recovered from injury. New Zealand's spin options are bolstered by all-rounders Ravindra, who is back in the squad for the first time since facing Bangladesh in January last year, and Glenn Phillips, who returns after touring Pakistan earlier this year. ""With Ajaz (Patel), Ish (Sodhi), Mitch, Glenn (Phillips) and Rachin we have a strong spin group that will offer good variety and options during the series,"" said Black Caps selector Sam Wells in a statement. Head coach Gary Stead will not take part in the tour following the ODI World Cup and will instead prepare for a busy home summer. His assistant Luke Ronchi will be in charge.

"Sri Lanka's sports minister was sacked Monday hours after he accused president Ranil Wickremesinghe of trying to assassinate him over his moves to clean up corruption at the cricket board. Officials said Roshan Ranasinghe was dismissed ahead of Monday's weekly cabinet meeting after he told parliament that Wickremesinghe should be held responsible if he was killed. ""I fear I could be killed over my work to clean up the cricket board,"" Ranasinghe told parliament, escalating a confrontation with Wickremesinghe who had been at loggerheads with the minister over the running of Sri Lanka Cricket. ""If I am assassinated on the road, the president and his chief of staff will be responsible,"" Ranasinghe said. There was no immediate reaction from Wickremesinghe except confirmation from his office that the minister was dismissed. Ranasinghe sacked the elected cricket board earlier this month after accusing office-bearers of gross corruption, a charge they have denied and are challenging in court. The cricket board is the richest sporting organisation in the otherwise bankrupt island country. The International Cricket Council suspended Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) earlier this month, saying it had failed to ensure there was no government interference in its affairs, violating the world body's rules. Ranasinghe has refused the president's calls to revoke the sacking of the board. The parliament backed the sports minister by passing a non-binding resolution three weeks ago asking the cricket board to resign pending a forensic audit of its accounts. Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee to investigate the ICC suspension. The cash-strapped country defaulted on its $46 billion debt in April last year after running out of foreign exchange to finance imports of even the most essential commodities, making life a misery for the island's 22 million people. At the peak of last year's crisis, months of civil unrest forced the ouster of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa when protesters stormed his residence. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A sharp turning delivery from Ajaz Patel brought an end to Zakir Hasan's innings in the morning session of Day one of the Sylhet Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand today, a sign of things to come later in the match. Batting first, Bangladesh openers Zakir and Mahmudul Hasan Joy did well to negate New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson in the initial overs. After the seamers failed to bring the breakthrough, skipper Southee handed the ball to left-arm spinner Ajaz, who broke the opening stand on 39 in his fourth over. The ball pitched on around the fifth stump line, then turned back sharply to crash into Zakir's off stump, ending his innings on 12 off 42 balls. Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh's skipper in the match, has joined Joy in the middle. Shanto took the attack to Ajaz in his following over, hitting him for a four and a six as Bangladesh reached 50-1 after 15 overs. Joy is unbeaten on 19 while Shanto is batting on 10.

"Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's overzealous approach cost him his wicket late in the morning session as Bangladesh went into the lunch interval on 104-2 on the first day of their Sylhet Test against New Zealand today. Shanto, who played a brisk knock of 37 off 35 balls, threw away his wicket with less than 10 minutes to go before lunch, top-edging a full toss delivery from part-time spinner Glenn Philipps to get caught by Kane Williamson. Philipps' scalp, which was his maiden wicket in Test cricket, broke a 53-run partnership between Shanto and Mahmudul Hasan Joy and helped the visitors end the session on equal standings. Joy is now batting on 42 and he is accompanied in the middle by Mominul Haque, who is unbeaten on three. Earlier, New Zealand's first success in the innings came from left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel, whose sharp turning delivery rattled Zakir Hasan's off stump, ending his innings on 12. Batting first, Joy and Zakir successfully negated the opening spell of New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson. After the seamers failed to bring the breakthrough, skipper Southee handed the ball to Ajaz, who broke the opening stand on 39 with a sharp turning delivery, signs of things to come later in the match. Shanto, who is leading the side in place of injured skipper Shakib Al Hasan, then came to the middle with a clear plan to attack the Kiwi spinners to unsettle them. He opened his account with a six straight down the ground against Ajaz and hit the spinner for a four two balls later. Shanto hit Ajaz for a couple more sixes and a four, which forced Southee to take the spinner off the attack. But his over-aggressive approach eventually caused his dismissal. The pitch in Sylhet has already shown signs of turn and inconsistent bounce, which should aid the hosts who have gone into the match with three spinners – Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan and Taijul Islam – and just one pacer in Shoriful Islam. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The 2025 edition of the ICC Champions Trophy could be shifted out of Pakistan or played in a hybrid model similar to this year's Asia Cup, according to reports on multiple outlets. Pakistan are scheduled to host the next edition of the eight-team ODI event two years later. However, there are serious doubts about whether the Indian team would go to the neighbouring country to take part in the event. Earlier this year, the Indias government refused to send their team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, which prompted the PCB to host the tournament in a hybrid model with Sri Lanka as co-hosts. According to Indian news agency PTI, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Zaka Ashraf and COO Salman Naseer met with the ICC executive board to discuss the uncertainty surrounding the tournament. ""Pakistani officials discussed the probability of the Indian board (BCCI) again refusing to send its team to Pakistan and made it clear that in any given situation, the ICC must avoid taking unilateral decisions on the tournament,"" a source told PTI. ""They also made it clear that in case of India not sending its team and its matches being moved to another country, than the ICC must compensate Pakistan for this,"" the source added. As per reports, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been listed as the potential host if the tournament gets shifted from Pakistan. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday sent a legal notice to its Indian counterpart for failing to honour an agreement to play a bilateral series, saying this had cost them $60 million.

But New Delhi denied clearance for the series following strained diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan owing to ceasefire violations in the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir. PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said legal measures were being sought as Pakistan was suffering lost revenues. ""We have initiated the legal process by sending BCCI a Notice of Dispute under the Dispute Resolution Committee Terms of reference of the International Cricket Council,"" Khan told AFP.

"Pakistan continued the overhaul of their backroom staff after failing to qualify for the knockout stages of the World Cup by appointing former international players Umar Gul and Saeed Ajmal as bowling coaches on Tuesday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said in a statement Gul would take over as fast bowling coach while Ajmal would be in charge of the spinners, with the duo's first assignment the test series against Australia starting next month. Gul - who retired in 2020 after playing 237 international matches and claiming 427 wickets - has been involved in several mentoring stints since, including one as the bowling coach of Afghanistan in 2022. Ajmal also has vast playing experience having represented Pakistan in 212 games and taking 447 wickets. He has also coached in the Pakistan Super League.

"Fakhar Zaman smashed his third consecutive ODI century to lead Pakistan to a remarkable record-breaking seven-wicket victory over New Zealand in Rawalpindi on Saturday. The Pakistan opener hit 17 boundaries and six massive sixes during his unbeaten knock of 180 not out as the Asian side successfully chased down New Zealand's healthy total of 336-5 with 10 deliveries to spare. It was Pakistan's second highest successful chase in ODIs but Pakistan skipper Babar Azam said they had always believed they could do it. ""After the first innings we had a discussion and told each other we have chased down similar totals in the past and we can do it again,"" he said. ""I think that was Fakher's best innings and the way he played astonished me."" The series now moves on to Karachi for the remaining three matches in the series on Wednesday, Friday and next Sunday. ""I think you have to take your hats off to Fakhar, the way he played was outstanding,"" said Latham. It was Fakhar's third ODI century in a row, and came after his 117 in the series opener on Thursday. He also scored a century against New Zealand in the last game of the previous series between the two sides earlier this year. "" It was my lucky day to score again against New Zealand,"" Fakhar said after he was dropped in Jimmy Neesham's successive overs after his half-century off 44 balls with 10 boundaries. ""I get a lot of liberty while playing with [Mohammad] Rizwan and he made things easier for me. I was told to stay at the crease till the end,"" he continued. ""We definitely believe we can come back and get back into this series.

"Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan hit a match-winning century against Sri Lanka in Hyderabad on Tuesday, which powered Pakistan to the highest successful run-chase ever in an ICC ODI World Cup match. Rizwan remained unbeaten on 131 off 121 balls as Pakistan chased down a 345-run target with six wickets in hand and 10 balls to spare at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium. But on his way to a match-winning knock, Rizwan had to battle through exhaustion, back pain and cramps. In the 36th over of the chase, Rizwan fell to the ground holding his back after seemingly hurting his back a couple of deliveries ago while trying to reach for a wide delivery. After receiving some treatment from the Pakistan team physio, Rizwan was back on his feet. In the following over, Rizwan charged down the wicket to Dhananjata de Silva and sent the ball over the ropes through the long-off region. But in the followthrough of that stroke, he collapsed to the ground in a rather dramatic fashion, clutching his right calf. The physio again rushed to the middle, treated him for the cramps and Rizwan was soon ready to resume his innings. After the match, when Rizwan was asked about his struggles in the middle after being named the player of the match, the 31-year-old gave a lighthearted response. ""Sometimes cramps, sometimes acting (smiles),"" Rizwan said at the post-match presentation. Rizwan and Abdullah Shafique, who made 113 off 103 balls, formed a 176-run partnership for the third wicket which set up the record chase for Pakistan. Rizwan revealed that even after losing two early wickets, the Pakistan team believed they could win the match. ""Every player in the dressing room had the belief we can chase that.

"Taijul Islam was struggling to come up with the words to describe his elation after his 10-wicket haul catapulted Bangladesh to their maiden win over New Zealand in home Tests at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium on Saturday. ""The feeling of winning against such a big team can't be expressed,"" Taijul told the media after the Tigers defeated the Kiwis by 150 runs on the fifth day of the Sylhet Test to take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series. The left-arm spinner led the Bangladesh attack in the match, claiming four wickets in the first innings and six in the second to finish with match figures of 10-184. The 31-year-old year said that they adopted an attacking approach throughout the match which resulted in a monumental win for the hosts. ""We wanted to follow our processes. We planned to keep attacking when we get in a winning position. That was our plan."" Taijul also attributed the win to all members of the team as everyone chipped in and played their role to complete the victory. ""Overall, everyone deserves the credit.

"When Kane Williamson, centurion in the first innings, came to bat in the second innings yesterday, the stump mic picked up Bangladesh fielders riling Taijul Islam up with 'this is your wicket.' Taijul has been one of Bangladesh's most crucial figures in Tests for a long time, especially at home. He usually bowls the lion's share of overs during Bangladesh's bowling innings and this time he needed to play a huge role in terms of making his presence felt in absence of the other left-arm spinner, Shakib Al Hasan. His teammates' confidence on him to do just that was what the stump mic picked up. Taijul is almost always the second fiddle in terms of attacking with spin when Shakib is in the side but without the ace all-rounder, Taijul's role was more pronounced. He had a simple plan -- to support his spin group of Mehedi Hasan Miraz and Nayeem Islam. ""To be honest, I cannot do what someone else is doing and someone else cannot do what I am doing. I always stay within my plan. Whether Shakib bhai is around or not there are other spinners with me and game by game the plan remains in a way that someone will take wickets and someone will contain the runs. ""If I was looking to contain runs, Nayeem or Miraj might have taken wickets. Whoever playing or not, the important thing is that we are playing well,"" Taijul said at the end of the day's play. But Taijul has appeared in more Tests since 2021 than Shakib. Since 2021, Shakib has played in seven Tests to Taijul's 14 appearances. In the seven Tests Taijul appeared alongside Shakib, his average went up to 36.32 (from 31.58) along with his strike-rate (88 compared to career strike-rate of 63.6) while his economy rate went down to 2.47 from a career economy rate of 2.47 – a clear indication that he was doing a containing job. Without Shakib, Taijul is a more attacking prospect. In the seven games he played alongside Shakib since 2021, he picked up 28 wickets. In the other seven Tests, he has bagged 43 wickets. Thus, he was handed the key to attack and lead. He would bag the in-form Kane Willamson for the second time in the Sylhet Test, yet again with an arm delivery that slipped past the right-hander's defences and rapped his pads. Williamson reviewed but started walking as soon as he saw the replay. ""I have been playing for nine years and probably they had the faith that I will be able to set him (Williamson) up and get his wicket,"" he said. Even when Shakib is playing, Taijul's role is crucial. With Shakib now at the latter stages of his career, there are suggestions he would opt out of Tests sooner rather than later. Taijul would then have to lead and he feels ready. ""If the coach and the captain give me priority certainly I will try to help,"" Taijul said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Soft dismissals, unforced errors have led to the demise of the Bangladesh top-order in recent times, and it was no exception against New Zealand in their third ICC World Cup fixture in Chennai yesterday. It was not uncommon to see the Bangladesh top four batter sent packing inside 13 overs, given it marked the seventh instance in the last 10 ODIs where Bangladesh went on to lose four wickets before reaching three figures. But what followed, after skipper Shakib Al Hasan steadied the ship Mushfiqur Rahim, was the most frustrating from the Bangladesh perspective. Veterans with five World Cup experience, Shakib and Mushfiqur did make their experience count somewhat, but the job was far from done for the two Bangladesh stalwarts when the former faltered. At 145 for four after 29 overs, knowing that they have a long tail, the situation required Shakib and Mushfiqur to play sensibly for another five to six overs to lay the platform of a near 270. A while earlier, Shakib had suffered a cramp and he proceeded without wearing a cap or a helmet in a never-before-seen act from the ace all-rounder. While it was not surprising to see the Bangladesh skipper opting to aim for the boundaries to compensate for his compromised running ability, his overtly aggressive approach did not reflect his wealth of experience. Following drinks break, spinner Rachin Ravindra was on the receiving end of a four and a six from Shakib. The next over, a top-edge off a Lockie Ferguson delivery resulted in a six over backward square leg as Shakib reached forty but he paid the price next ball, having played one shot too many. Eventually, Mushfiqur Rahim's 66 and a rearguard action from seasoned campaigner Mahmudullah Riyad, who scored an unbeaten 49-ball 41 on his first appearance in the ongoing event, gave their bowlers something to defend. Going back to the innings' start, Liton Das chose to mark his birthday with a golden duck, caught at deep fine leg, and that too in the first delivery of the innings bowled by Trent Boult. Bangladesh, thus, were on the back foot from the onset on what turned out to be a batting-friendly surface. And despite all the noise that the surface at the MA Chidambaram stadium was primed to be a spinner's paradise, New Zealand pacers eventually shared seven of nine scalps. Bangladesh batters can only blame themselves at the end of day. Young Tanzid Hasan Tamim timed a flick and found the fielder at the in-field after a promising 16 off 17 balls, while in-form Mehedi Hasa Miraz, in at number three, departed in similar fashion to Liton after a well-compiled 30. The worst fear was coming true for Bangladesh, it seemed, once Najmul Hossain Shanto – who averaged 80-plus in last five ODIs – was the next to get out following another soft dismissal against the run of play. This time, off-spinner Glenn Phillips found his victim without much effort. Apart from Mushfiqur, who fell to Matt Henry's brilliantly executed slower delivery that bounced low, none of the top six Bangladesh batters looked like they were up for an occasion of World Cup's magnitude. The execution was vividly lacking on the day, but the team management's decision to keep shuffling the top-order is also bound to come under heavy scrutiny. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"In the wake of Bangladesh's disastrous World Cup campaign, The Daily Star's Al-Amin communicated with former BCB president and Member of Parliament, Saber Hossain Chowdhury. Saber, who oversaw Bangladesh's first qualification for the ICC World Cup in 1999 and the country's subsequent elevation to a Test-playing nation, expressed his frustration with the state of the sport in the country, putting the current cricket board on the dock for its lack of professionalism, accountability and nepotism. Following are the excerpts of the interview: The Daily Star (DS): Bangladesh made their World Cup exit with only two wins against seven defeats. How disappointing was the result to you? Saber Hossain Chowdhury (SHC): Acutely disappointing. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), head coach Chandika Hathurusingha and even the players were fuelling expectations prior to the World Cup that we would make it to the semifinals. The shocking reality is that we were the first team to be out of the race for a top-four finish; we lost to one of the two qualifiers (Netherlands). We finished just above the two qualifiers (the other being Sri Lanka) and the margin of defeat in each instance just added insult to injury. If we only consider the teams who did not have to quality for this 2023 World Cup, we are in fact at the bottom of the final points table.  DS: People are saying that it was the second most disappointing World Cup for Bangladesh since their maiden appearance in the showpiece event in 1999. What is your take on that? SHC: In our World Cup debut in 1999, as an Associate Member of ICC, we notched up two wins (against Pakistan and Scotland) in five matches. Here, we were with 23 years of Test experience and we have won two matches out of nine. Astonishing! We are literally going backwards and regressing whereas a country such as Afghanistan, who secured Test Status 17 years after we did and are confronted with manifold challenges, are marching ahead. We have also lost to the Netherlands who are not even a Test-playing nation. Ireland, though they were not able to qualify on this occasion, is another country that is making great progress. I, thus, see this as our worst World Cup and BCB has saved up the worst for its latest World Cup campaign.  DS: Players and team management can certainly be blamed for the debacle. Do you think the BCB should share equal blame? SHC: Passing the buck and putting the blame on others has been a consistent hallmark of the BCB leadership over the past decade. When fingers are pointed and shortcomings exposed, it is always either someone else's fault or it is a conspiracy. Who has appointed team management; who has appointed the selectors; who interferes in team selection? We all know, and I am not revealing any secrets here, that despite the glorified titles and job descriptions, BCB continues to be an absolute one-man show with no semblance of accountability or collective leadership.  DS: There was a lot of drama over the selection of the team for the World Cup. The country has also painfully witnessed an open rift between two iconic players. Do you think the whole episode played a big part in Bangladesh's failure? SHC: Preparing and planning for the greatest spectacle in the form of a World Cup is no child's play and should have been taken seriously. What is needed is stability, continuity, integrity and professional competence, not clowns providing comic relief amongst the chaos and drama. DS: The BCB reappointed Chandika Hathurusingha as head coach of the national team ahead of the World Cup. Was that a wise decision, considering his departure in an unprofessional manner in his first stint?  SHC: Till date, we do not know why he departed, let alone why he was reappointed for a second stint. Was there a full and open discussion underpinning a transparent process in either or both of these instances? DS: Do you think the current BCB leadership followed the standard procedure in appointing a captain and his deputy? SHC: These are both very important positions and the choices merit careful consideration and evaluation, including those peculiar to a limited-overs competition and that too in the context of a World Cup. One would hope that the process and procedure has indeed been a comprehensive and inclusive one, but this question should be directed at the BCB. DS: A lot of things happened in India that highlighted a lack of discipline and cohesion in the team. Venting his frustration to the media, team director Khaled Mahmud had said that he was not involved with some issues that his position mandated him to do. It indicates that the board has given free reins to certain individuals which eventually backfired. Do you agree with the notion? SHC: Interesting that you are quoting someone who has been favoured all along by the current leadership and has been tasked with multiple, conflicting roles in the past. It's even more interesting that Allan Donald has been issued with a show-cause notice for speaking to the media whereas this individual is evidently above the rules that apply to others. We are all familiar with Individuals disowning or distancing themselves from failing leadership and this is of course nothing new. DS: After the debacle, some heads may roll. Do you think the changing and chopping will really solve a deep-rooted problem, starting with the poor state of domestic cricket to an obsession only over the senior men's team? SHC: Heads have rolled in the past and will also, no doubt, roll again as scapegoats will be conveniently identified. I suspect, yet again, it will be the appointed ones, and not those who have decided on and finalised these appointments, that will actually be taking the fall. Domestic cricket continues to be in a mess, does not have the needed focus/priority, there is hardly any governance and allegations of match-fixing and biased umpiring remain uninvestigated. Our international cricket will only be strong to the extent of the strength of the base provided by our domestic calendar and structure. DS: People are calling for the incumbent BCB President Nazmul Hassan Papon to take full responsibility for the failure and resign. Are you on the same page? SHC: Enough is enough. I think all the board members of the BCB should resign as it is their collective failure when looked at through the lens of accountability. They have let the nation down big time and the buck must stop with them. It is staggering to comprehend and grasp that a game which is the number one sport in the country, is a passion for millions of Bangladeshis across the world, has a rich tradition, is supported robustly by sponsors, has high visibility and media interest and, last but not the least, is sitting on a fund of BDT 1000 crores (thanks to the share of global sponsorships we earn as a Full Member of the ICC), is ironically being run by a board which is perhaps the most inept and unprofessional in Bangladesh's cricketing history. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt, who was banned five years from cricket for his involvement in spot-fixing, was named in the three-member consultant panel to chief selector Wahab Riaz by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) yesterday. This is the first time Butt is being offered an official role with the PCB since his involvement in the Lord's Test spot-fixing row in 2010. Butt, who has played 33 Tests, 78 ODIs and 24 T20Is for Pakistan, returned to domestic cricket after his ban ended in 2015, however, never made it back to the national side. The 39-year-old will now work alongside former Pakistan cricketers Kamran Akmal and Rao Iftikhar Anjum as consultants for the newly appointed chief selector Wahab. Butt will begin his role as consultant from Pakistan's five-match T20I series against New Zealand in next year's January. PCB also named former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez as the new team director and also the team's head coach for their Test series in Australia in December followed by their tour to New Zealand next month. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The recently ousted Pakistan Cricket Board chief Ramiz Raja took to social media on Monday to unravel the mystery behind his sudden exit, where he took a dig at incoming PCB chief Najam Sethi and revealed the ill-treatment, which followed after his ouster. ""They way they attacked the cricket board. They didn't even let me take my stuff. Early morning at 9 around 17 guys stormed at the office, which felt as if the Federal Investigation Agency of Pakistan has raided the office,"" the former Pakistan cricketer said while taking questions from fans, the video of which is available on Raja's official YouTube channel. He added: ""They are least interested in cricket. The cricket board puts them in a powerful position, and all they want is people keep bowing in front of them."" Raja also lamented the fact he was sacked even before his contract could get over and it comes at a time when international cricket is returning to the country. ""To bring just one person you changed the entire constitution of Pakistan Cricket Board. I have never seen this happen in the world that to adjust Najam Sethi, you had to change the constitution. ""In the middle of the season, when teams are coming to play in Pakistan, you have done this, and then you changed the chief selector. The point is that Mohammad Wasim whether he was doing a good job or not, is a former Test cricketer, and you should have made him leave with respect,"" said Raja. He added: ""This Najam Sethi is tweeting 2:15am at night that Ramiz Raja has been sacked, start congratulating me. I have played Test cricket, this is my field, and it hurts to see these people from outside cricket trying to act like a Messiah. I know that their motives are non-cricketing.

"Pakistan's cricket chief Najam Sethi has issued a warning to Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) to keep their players' behaviour in check during the upcoming series between the two countries in Sharjah. Last year, when the two teams met in Sharjah in Asia Cup, Asif Ali was seen involved in a heated exchange of words with Afghan fast bowler Fareed Ahmad Malik. Fareed pushed Asif first, which prompted the batsman was seen raised his bat at the speedster, after which the other players and umpires on the field had to intervene. ""I had a chat with Afghanistan officials in Dubai about crowd control and their players' behaviour. What is the guarantee about managing your fans and players, because past experiences haven't been good,"" Sethi was quoted as saying in an interview. ""We told Afghanistan board to control their players. Winning and losing is part of the game. We have experience about winning and losing so we can control our emotions, but they are new to international cricket, so they need to keep their players in check,"" he added. During the Asia Cup match, Afghan fans were seen hitting Pakistan fans after the game with chairs as their team lost a close encounter. ""There were two assurances. UAE authorities have made a new plan, in which they will try their best that Pakistan fans and Afghanistan fans won't sit together,"" Sethi said. ""In addition to that, strict action will be taken against rowdiness from people. There will be strict security in Sharjah."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"According to reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is set to provide a significant salary increase to its cricketers through updated central contracts. This development arises amidst ongoing discussions between the PCB and the country's cricket players regarding their involvement in various T20 Leagues abroad. Babar Azam, Shaheen Afridi, and Mohammad Rizwan, three prominent players of the Pakistan cricket team, might secure top spots in the Category A contract list, according to an ESPNcricinfo report. The proposed monthly retainer amount of PKR 4.5 million, equivalent to approximately $15,900, is four times higher than what the previous Pakistan stalwarts received in their central contracts. Officials involved in the process have described this increment in retainer values as a ""historic"" step. As per reports, players in Category B are expected to receive a monthly retainer of PKR 3 million, approximately $10,600, while those in Categories C and D might get PKR 0.75-1.5 million monthly, approximately $2650-5300. The PCB is planning to change the central contract format from last year, which separated players based on their participation in red ball and white ball cricket. The four categories of contracts will revert to the format used two years ago. Despite the significant increase in central contract retainers, the falling Pakistan rupee in the past year could offset some of the gains. However, the PCB's annual earnings from the ICC's new revenue-sharing model are expected to more than double to PKR 9.6 billion, approximately USD 34 million, prompting the board to provide higher compensation to Pakistan cricketers than ever before. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Chennai Super Kings all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja dedicated his side's fifth IPL title win to skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Chasing a revised target of 171 from 15 overs after a lengthy rain interruption, Chennai survived intense drama before Jadeja sealed their victory, milking 10 runs off the last two deliveries. ""I'd like to dedicate this win to a special member of the CSK side, MS Dhoni. It feels amazing to win my fifth title in front of my home crowd. I'm from Gujarat, and it's a special feeling,"" he said after CSK pipped the Gujarat Titans by five wickets in a rain-marred fixture. Chennai needed 13 runs from the last over from Mohit Sharma, who conceded three runs in his first four deliveries. Needing 10 off the last two, Jadeja hit Mohit over his head for a six and followed it with a boundary to seal a thrilling victory. ""I was just trying to swing hard because every ball was important,"" Jadeja said of the dramatic last over. I knew anything could happen, so I was trying to swing hard and hit it straight.""

"A crowd of more than 100,000 was expected to fill the world's biggest cricket stadium on Sunday for the final of the Indian Premier League and the likely farewell of superstar M.S. Dhoni. Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings will take on holders Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad, aiming for a record-equalling fifth title in the culmination of the big-bucks T20 tournament. But Gujarat, led by Hardik Pandya, will be no pushovers playing in their home stadium as they look to retain the title after a fairytale, debut-season victory a year ago. Pandya lifted the trophy in front of a 101,566 fans at the 132,000-capacity stadium in 2022, a world record for a T20 cricket match. But organisers were confident that record would fall on Sunday evening. A media official of the state association told AFP that ""tickets are sold out for the grand finale and we are expecting a full house"". The authorities had expected a packed house for the final playoff as well, but only about 75,000 fans turned up for the Friday match when Gujarat hammered Mumbai Indians. Scores of fans looked upbeat on Saturday as they queued to redeem their online tickets at a counter outside the stadium. Suresh Babu, a software engineer, told AFP he had travelled from Chennai, at the other end of the country, ""to see Dhoni lift the trophy one more time"". ""I know it may be his last, but we pray that he comes back again next year,"" added the 43-year-old, who wore Dhoni's yellow Chennai jersey. Gujarat have enjoyed huge home support in their second season in the competition, but loyalties will be divided due to Dhoni's presence. The 41-year-old remains a huge draw in cricket-mad India and the finale is believed to be his last game as a player, despite the wicketkeeper-batsman saying he will make a call on his IPL future later this year. The former India captain has filled venues all over the country during the current season, and the Narendra Modi Stadium will be no different in the tournament final. Sharif, a T-shirt seller who goes by just one name, told AFP: ""Last year it was just Pandya jerseys that were sold but this time Dhoni's Chennai number 7 T-shirt is equally in demand."" A young fan wearing a Pandya jersey said: ""I want Hardik to win the IPL again but still want to see Dhoni hit the helicopter shot for a six.""

"Match facts Saturday, May 16, 2015 Start time 2000 local (1430 GMT) Big Picture Rajasthan Royals must be feeling an uneasy sense of déjà vu. They began the season with five wins in five games but like last year, when they appeared to be cruising to the playoffs, they have lost steam midway. Royals find themselves needing to win their last game, and yet that might not be enough. That there has also been a change in captaincy, with Shane Watson stepping down ahead of the Chennai Super Kings encounter, has added another interesting dimension. But, with Steven Smith having stood in for Watson in the opening stages of the tournament, his elevation might not be an earth-shattering development. Knight Riders, on the other hand, would be inclined to look back ruefully at their five-run loss to Mumbai Indians on Thursday, but will have little emotional bandwidth to do so. They know that a win would get them into the playoffs, but a defeat would leave them pinning their hopes on other results. Both the matches played at the Brabourne Stadium thus far have been high-scoring affairs and this one isn't likely to be any different. It could well be a contest between Royals' batsmen and Knight Riders' spinners, who have contributed 35 wickets in the tournament. Form guide Rajasthan Royals LLWLL (last five completed matches, most recent first) Kolkata Knight Riders LWWWL Watch out for… Chris Morris has been a worthy investment for Royals, and he has contributed with both bat and ball. Besides being their second-highest wicket-taker, he has also been the most economical of Royals' bowlers. He has also scored 72 from five innings with a strike-rate of 189.47 without being dismissed once. By playing him too low down the order, Royals have perhaps not completely exploited his batting potential. A promotion in a crunch game might not be a bad idea. Yusuf Pathan has been a revelation in this year's IPL, having shed his one-dimensional slogging in favour of a more balanced approach. He showed maturity in taking Knight Riders to the brink of victory against Mumbai, but his dismissal in the last over changed the course of the match. Marrying sangfroid with his characteristic big-hitting, Pathan could well be both the middle-order marshall as well as the finisher. Stats and trivia Robin Uthappa (11) is third on the list of most dismissals behind the stumps in this IPL. Wriddhiman Saha (13) and Dinesh Karthik (12) occupy the top-two positions Ajinkya Rahane (4) is joint-second with Lendl Simmons and Shreyas Iyer, behind only David Warner (6) for the most number of 50-plus scores made in IPL 2015 Quotes ""Gautam Gambhir is one of the best captains in the IPL. He always goes for wickets and not containing the batsmen. Even in the 15th or 16th over if there is a new batsman at the crease, he will have a short-leg and slip."" Knight Riders bowling mentor Wasim Akram is a fan of Gautam Gambhir's leadership. ""I doff my hat off to Watto for giving up the captaincy and taking more responsibility for his batting. It was a responsible thing to do. We all appreciate it as team men and move on.""

"Bangladesh's fast bowling sensation Mustafizur Rahman left for India to take part in the 11th edition of the Indian Premier League for his new side, the Mumbai Indians, yesterday. Mustafizur announced himself in grand style on his maiden appearance in the cash-rich T20 tournament for Sunrisers Hyderabad, being adjudged the Emerging Player of the tournament after magnificent performances with the ball. The left-arm seamer ended up scalping 17 wickets in 16 games at an average of 24.76 with a miserly economy of 6.90 and was instrumental behind Sunrisers maiden IPL title. Although Mustafizur did not have a memorable outing the following season, managing to play just one game where he gave away 34 runs in 2.4 overs. He was released with the Surisers ahead of this season, giving defending champions Mumbai the opportunity to rope him in. Mustafizur will take the field for his new team for the first time against the Chennai Super Kings in the tournament opener on April 7 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Bangladesh ace Shakib Al Hasan was also released ahead of the season by the Kolkata Knight Riders, who he had represented in the past seven season but played for only once in the last edition. Shakib will be looking to embark on a new adventure with Sunrisers Hyderabad and the champion all-rounder is expected to leave Bangladesh tomorrow. He will take on Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad's first game of the tournament on April 9 at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Jasprit Bumrah is no stranger to bowling no-balls - his costliest one coming in last year's Champions Trophy final - but he got away without scrutiny when he dismissed Umesh Yadav. The on-field umpire immediately asked to see if he had overstepped. The replay shown, though, has Umesh at the non-striker's end, and the heel of Bumrah's front foot lands well inside the crease. The commentators were surprised that it was even checked. It went unnoticed that Umesh was in the picture at the non-striker's end until Twitter user @ronak_169 brought it to ESPNcricinfo's notice. While this was not significant to the result - Royal Challengers were 137 for 7, chasing 214, with only 13 balls left - it once again raises the possibility of this human error in more critical stages of the match. Sachin Tendulkar, in the 2011 IPL, and MS Dhoni on a tour of West Indies, suffered similar fates. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The two-time champions defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by two wickets in a low-scoring thriller at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. It was not a good outing for Bangladesh's ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan as he scored just 12 in Sunrisers' innings and was then taken for 20 off his two overs during Chennai's chase. CSK will now play the summit clash on Sunday, whereas Sunrisers have to face the winners of the Eliminator between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals in the Qualifier 2 for the second shot on the final on Friday. Du Plessis completed the run chase with a six as CSK chased down the 140-run target in 19.1 overs. The South African remained unbeaten on 67 off 42 balls, which included four sixes and five fours, and added unconquered 27 runs off 8 balls with Shardul Thakur (15 off 5 balls). Earlier, CSK bowling attack utilised lively pitch to the fullest as they restricted Sunrisers to a modest 139/7. Carlos Brathwaite (43* off 29 balls), skipper Kane Willamson (24) and Yusuf Pathan (24) were the useful contributors for Sunrisers on a track that offered good bounce. SCORES IN BRIEF Sunrisers Hyderabad: 139 for 7 in 20 overs (Williamson 24, Pathan 24, Brathwaite 43 not out; Bravo 2-25) Chennai Super Kings: 140 for 8 in 19.1 overs (Du Plessis 67 not out, Raina 22, Thakur 15 not out; Sharma 2-30, Kaul 2-32, Rashid 2-11) Result: Chennai Super Kings won by 2 wickets. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Shakib Al Hasan had an outing to forget for Sunrisers Hyderabad, but powered by an impressive team performance, they defeated the Rajasthan Royals by 11 runs to claim the top spot in the IPL yesterday night. Hyderabad had posted 151 for seven after electing to bat, building around captain Kane Williamson's 63-run knock. Bangladesh's ace all-rounder Shakib scored just six runs off as many balls before giving away 30 runs from his four overs, but right-armer Sandeep Sharma's brilliant overs, which yielded just 15 runs were the crux of Hyderabad's defense. In the day's later match, opener Chris Lynn anchored his innings to perfection as Kolkata Knight Riders secured a comfortable six-wicket win against Royal Challengers Bangalore. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former England captain Andrew Strauss forecast Wednesday the Indian Premier League would eclipse American football's NFL to become ""the biggest domestic sporting event in the world"" as he praised it for sparking one of cricket's ""great steps forward"". He also said the recent creation of a women's IPL would ""accelerate"" the growth of the female game in spectacular fashion. A highly lucrative franchise T20 event backed by wealthy business figures and entertainment stars, the IPL has also led to the creation of similar competitions, such as Australia's Big Bash and the Caribbean Premier League. In the process, players on the global T20 circuit earn a good living from cricket without having to represent their countries. This has led to fears about the future of international cricket, in particular five-day Tests, but Strauss said issues of ""overkill"" had existed before the advent of the IPL in 2008 and were still evident at international and county level. Strauss, delivering the annual Cowdrey lecture at Lord's, urged his audience to embrace the IPL despite fears it meant the game had ""sold its soul"". ""As the Indian economy grows, it is expected that by the time it reaches parity with the size of the USA in 2040, the value of the IPL is likely to be six times what it is today -- this is going to be the biggest domestic sporting tournament in the world, bar none,"" Strauss said. - 'Earth-shattering sum' - ""If you allow yourself to keep bound up in the thesis that the purpose of the game is to bring diverse people together, whether playing or watching, and to allow cricket to educate and connect, then surely the rise of franchise cricket is one of the great steps forward. ""More players are playing in different parts of the world, experiencing new places and meeting new people, more and more people around the globe are engaged with the great game that we all love so much."" Turning to the new five-team women's IPL, Strauss said it would ""accelerate"" the growth of women's cricket. ""The first IPL franchises have just been sold for an earth shattering sum of £465 million ($572.5 million),"" the 45-year-old former opener added. ""Women's cricket is truly standing on its own two feet and is likely to be in the top three sports for earning potential for any young girl with talent and an ambition to play sport professionally."" Strauss, meanwhile, said the attacking way in which England red-ball coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes had overseen nine wins from 10 Tests since taking charge in May, compared to a mere one in 17 before they joined forces, augured well for the future of the five-day game. ""I firmly believe that the Test series that capture our imaginations today -- the ones that we really look forward to -- aren't going anywhere,"" Strauss insisted. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pakistan players may be banned from competing in the Indian Premier League but TV footage of the lucrative tournament played a part in the team's opening World Cup win. Of the 15-man Pakistan squad, only all-rounders Mohammad Nawaz and Agha Salman had ever visited the country before this World Cup. Nawaz was part of the team which played at the 2016 World Twenty20 while Salman turned out for the Lahore Lions in the 2014 T20 Champions League. Current captain and star batsman Babar Azam was initially named in the 2016 T20 squad but withdrew with an injury. ""We have come to India for the first time so we don't have much of an idea of playing in India,"" admitted Saud Shakeel, man of the match as Pakistan defeated the Netherlands in Hyderabad on Friday. ""But we have seen a little bit of the IPL and some matches in Hyderabad so that helped."" Shakeel certainly had few problems adapting to his new surroundings with a fine 68 in the 81-run win which helped Pakistan to victory over the Dutch. Mohammad Rizwan also made 68 in a 120-run stand after Pakistan were reeling at 38-3 in Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi Stadium. Pakistan openers Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-haq fell for 12 and 15 respectively while Azam managed just an 18-ball five. ""The tournament has just started and we are playing in Hyderabad,"" said Shakeel. ""Everyone knows that the ball stops early on here on this pitch. There are chances of losing a wicket.""

"Captain Rohit Sharma struck a brilliant 94 before his bowlers produced a clinical performance as Mumbai Indians beat Royal Challengers Bangalore by 46 runs in their IPL match on Tuesday. Put into bat, Mumbai recovered from a shock start of 0 for 2 to post 213 for 6, their highest score of the season, mainly through the splendid batting of Rohit (94 in 52 balls) and opener Evin Lewis (65 in 42 balls). Then, the Mumbai bowlers led by left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya (3/28) stopped RCB at 167 for 8 in 20 overs to notch up their first win in their fourth match of the season. RCB captain Virat Kohli's typically aggressive 62-ball 92 not out was the lone bright spot in the visitors' run-chase of 214 as they lost their way after a promising start. Kohli, who opened the RCB innings, slammed 4 sixes and 7 fours in his unbeaten knock but none of his batting colleagues gave him support. The next best was that of the other opener Quinton de Kock who made 19 from 12 balls. RCB's defeat at the Wankhede Stadium was also third in four games this season. RCB made an encouraging start in pursuit of the daunting target when Kohli and de Kock put on 40 runs before a twin strike in three balls by left-arm pacer Mitchell McClenaghan (2/24) in the fifth over arrested their progress. The New Zealander bowled de Kock for 19 and then struck another big blow by having another South African A B de Villiers (1) caught in the deep to make it 42 for two. There was a brief revival with Kohli adding 32 runs with Mandeep Singh (16) before Krunal Pandya grabbed two wickets off successive balls. Krunal dismissed Mandeep and Corey Anderson (0) to push the visitors firmly on the back foot at 75 for four. Earlier, Mumbai Indians made a grand recovery from a shock start through sparkling half centuries from captain Rohit and Lewis. SCORES IN BRIEF MUMBAI INDIANS: 213 for 6 in 20 overs (Lewis 65, Sharma 94, H Pandya 17 not out; Yadav 2-36, Anderson 2-47) ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE: 167 for 8 in 20 overs (Kohli 92 not out, De Kock 19; Bumrah 2-28, K Pandya 3-28, McClenaghan 2-24) Result: Mumbai Indians won by 46 runs. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Chris Gayle hit an unbeaten 62, his third fifty-plus knock on the trot, as Kings XI Punjab recorded a massive nine-wicket win against hosts Kolkata Knight Riders at the rain-hit Eden Gardens yesterday. The 38-year-old Jamaican, who only a couple of days back said that Vireder Sehwag has saved the Indian Premier League by drafting him in the billion-dollar tournament, once again provided the flare he is revered for in the shortest format of the game. The power-hitting left-hander made the impressive Kolkata total of 191 an easy chase in company of Lokesh Rahul as the left-right opening pair plundered 96 runs before rain intervened in 8.2 overs. Interestingly, Gayle hit the last ball before rain for a six against leg-spinner Piyush Chawla to complete his fifty off 27 balls. He then hit the same bowler for another six when the game resumed and Kings XI were given a revised target of 125 in 13 overs. Kings XI raced to the target with 11 balls to spare and for the loss of Rahul, who hit a blistering 27-ball 60 that contained nine fours and two sixes. Gayle, who hit a majestic 104 in the previous game against Sunrisers Hyderabad at Mohali, struck half a dozen sixes and five fours in his 38-ball 62 and in the process became the leading run-scorer of the tournament. It was Kings XI's first win in their last six attempts at the Eden and they finished as table-toppers of the IPL on Saturday. SCORES IN BRIEF KKR: 191 for 7 (Lynn 74, Karthik 43, Uthappa 34; Tye 2-30) Kings XI Punjab: 126 for 1 (Target 125 in 13 overs) Gayle 62 not out, Rahul 60; Narine 1-23) Result: Kings XI won by 9 wickets (D/L method) Player-of-the-match: Lokesh Rahul. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"In a high-scoring entertainer, RCB bowlers especially, Tim Southee, who conceded just six runs in the 17th over, hold their nerves to defend a commanding 218 for six. Sunrisers captain Kane Williamson threatened to take the game away with a sublime 81 off 42 balls. But once the New Zealand right-hander was holed out in the deep off the first ball in the final over with his side needing 20 runs, the game was irrevocably tilted to RCB's way. Sunrisers eventually finished on 204 for three with Manish Pandey hitting an unbeaten 62. But he was also responsible for not allowing much of the strike to Williamson in the last five overs. Earlier, RCB rode on half centuries by AB de Villiers (69) and Moen Ali (65) to post a commanding total. Colin de Grandhomme with a 17-ball 40 provided the late flourish in a game where so many catches were dropped. However, amidst those let offs, two stunning catches were taken. Surrisers Rashid Khan, who took three wickets for 27 runs in his four overs, took a one-handed catch at long-on. But it was De Villiers's stunner at deep mid-wicket that dismissed a menacing Alex Hales that would surely go down as one of the best catches in the IPL. Hales stepped out and muscled Moen Ali's length ball and thought he had cleared it. But AB leapt high and realizing that the ball was swirling away instinctively puts his right hand out and pulled off a one-handed stunner even as it continued to curl away. Bangladesh's premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan bowled a decent spell for Sunrisers, conceding 35 runs in his four overs. RCB are now in fifth position with 12 points, leveled with Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI. Their game on Saturday against Royals in Jaipur will be a knockout shootout. Royal Challengers Bangalore: 218 for six in 20 overs (De Villiers 69, Moen Ali 65, Grandhomme 40; Rashid 3-27) Sunrisers Hyderabad: 204 for three in 20 overs (Hales 37, Williamson 81, M Pandey 62 not out; Chahal 1-28) Result: Royal Challengers Bangalore won by 14 runs Player-of-the-match: AB de Villiers আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Mumbai Indians continued their phenomenal rise in the Indian Premier League table with a 102-run win against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Eden Gardens yesterday. The Rohit Sharma-led side posted 210 for six, thanks to a whirlwind 62 off 21 balls from young Ishan Kishan and a nine-ball 24 from Australian Ben Cutting. Kishan's innings featured six sixes, four of which came in a single over. Kolkata's chase was hamstrung by early blows, and they fell behind the eightball too soon before eventually being bowled out for 108. The defending champions, who had won only one of their first six matches, have now won four of their last five matches, displacing Kolkata from fourth position.

"With the record of winning his two previous final appearances of the Indian Premier League with Kolkata Knight Riders, Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan will be looking to add a third IPL title to his cabinet. This time, though, the ace all-rounder will be featuring for his new side Sunrisers Hyderabad, who will be taking on MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai today. Although Afghanistan's Rashid Khan took the limelight in their 14-run win over KKR in the second qualifier with an all-round display, Shakib did play a crucial role in the victory. He scored a vital 24-ball 28 before being run out in an unlucky way and later bowled economical spell to concede just 16 runs from his three opvers, picking up the prized scalp of KKR skipper Dinesh Karthik. After having been largely overlooked by KKR last year, Shakib has been shown tremendous faith by his team management at his new franchise. And champion all-rounder has repaid the faith, scoring 216 runs in 16 games and bagging 14 wickets at an economy rate of below-eight. As the lone survivor of the Bangladeshi contingent in the IPL after the departure of Mustafizur Rahman's Mumbai Indians before the playoffs stage, the onus is on Shakib to keep the Bangladeshi flag flying high in the most prestigious franchise cricket league. However, it will be a tough ask for the 2016 champions as they will be up against a strong Chennai side, who have beaten them all three times the two sides have met this year. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

KKR chased down the small target with two overs to spare with Chris Lynn top-scoring with a 42-ball 45 while skipper Dinesh Karthik remaining not out on 41 off 31 deliveries.

"Fearsome South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has joined the Mustafizur Rahman fan club, paying the Bangladeshi left-arm paceman perhaps the highest compliment that can be paid to left-handed pace bowlers. His latest Indian Premier League outing on Tuesday for Sunrisers Hyderabad against Rising Pune Supergiants saw a rare blip as he was taken for 21 runs from his two overs, but he should be buoyed by arguably the greatest fast bowler of this generation comparing him to one of the greatest that ever played the game: Pakistan swing king Wasim Akram. ""Mustafizur has got the skill set, X-factor Wasim Akram had. I wouldn't say Mustafizur is swinging as much as Akram did but it is fantastic to see him bowl."" Steyn said in an exclusive interview with the India Today website yesterday. Steyn is playing for the Gujarat Lions in the 2016 IPL, the competition where Mustafizur has most recently come into the spotlight by taking wickets and mesmerising opposition batsmen. Mustafizur has taken the cricketing world by storm since his international debut in the T20I against Pakistan in April last year. Since then, he has taken 52 wickets in 24 international matches and his three five-wicket hauls in ODIs have been instrumental in Bangladesh's rousing series wins over India and South Africa in 2015. But his supreme control and nearly indecipherable changes of pace, as much as his brilliant international statistics, have made him an irresistible prospect for Twenty20 cricket. It was therefore no surprise that he became only the sixth Bangladeshi to be picked by an IPL side. The 20-year-old, nicknamed the Fizz, has already provided some of the most exciting moments of the IPL this year. His in-swinging yorker that cleaned up Andre Russell was a spectacle. And on Saturday, he bowled 16 dot balls in his four-over spell and finished with figures of 4-1-9-2. ""Every year somebody comes up, somebody steps up. At the World Cup, last year, we had Trent Boult and Mitchell Starc who came out and did something different. They both were bowling yorkers and swinging the white ball extremely well. While Starc was hitting 100 mph-mark, Boult was swinging it upfront. Now we have got Mustafizur from Bangladesh. I hope he goes from strength to strength. I hope we have a few more guys like Mustafizur next season,"" Steyn said. ""We are so used to right arm bowlers who bowl quick and also bowl off-cutters to surprise batsmen. Now this guy is a left-armer and his cutters and pace changes are things that nobody has seen before,"" Steyn said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh left-arm pacer, Mustafizur Rahman caught the eyes of cricket enthusiasts and critics with the unusual talent on his debut, and has gone from strength to strength with each hurdle he crossed. Having made his international debut in 2015, Mustafizur or Fizz (as his teammates dearly call him), has become one essential element of the team. Famous for his off-cuters, he has left the best of batters clueless. Mustafizur has grown as one of the most successful bowlers in the limited-overs format, reports Cricket Country. The player made appearances in tournaments like Indian Premier League (IPL), NatWest T20 Blast and Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) apart from the international fixtures. As the bowler turns 21, here are some of his top spells so far in his short yet brilliant career. Mustafizur made his international debut in a one-off Twenty20 International (T20I) that Bangladesh played against Pakistan at home. Playing along with experienced players like Shakib Al Hasan and skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, he emerged as the highest wicket-taker of the side, bagging two. He dismissed two of the most important players in the visiting side, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez. Pakistan put up a par 141 and with fireworks from Shakib and Sabbir Rahman, Bangladesh went on to win the match. Mustafizur’s next challenge was facing neighbours India at home, and he overcame it with flying colours. Being a young bowler who has hardly played much international cricket before, Mustafizur pulled off an excellent job protecting the 307 that Bangladesh had put up against India. The much-famed Indian batting line-up who had tamed them months back in the ICC World Cup 2015 were capable of chasing it down but the young Fizz came in the way. His 5-for included the better batsmen — Rohit Sharma, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja, which resulted in a 79-run-win for Bangladesh. When India thought of getting themselves back on track to win the next fixture, Mustafizur made sure he continued with his form and did not let India do so. The visitors were restricted at a below-the-par total of 200, with MS Dhoni being the highest run-getter for the side with his 47. He bagged wickets of Rohit, Dhoni, Raina and Jadeja. Bangladesh cruised to another win and Mustafizur received consecutive Man of the Match awards. Bangladesh were playing Zimbabwe at home when Mustafizur got his third 5-for within a span of six months. The hosts had put up a decent 276 against Zimbabwe with openers Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal scoring 73 each. Mustafizur came into action and dismissed opener Chamu Chibhabha and Regis Chakabva in quick succession, later on removed Sikandar Raza. Zimbabwe were bundled for 215 and Bangladesh won by 61 runs. Mustafizur did not get to play much international cricket before heading into the ICC World T20 2016. Facing India in the tournament, the bowler gave the Indian batsmen a tough time. Mustafizur removed Rohit Sharma in the sixth over and Indian players kept losing wickets in regular intervals thereafter. They put up a not-so-safe score of 146. The match was one of the most exciting ones of the tournament as Bangladesh had all the chances to win it till the last ball but lost in by a run. However, the bowler followed the performance up by a brilliant performance against New Zealand. The Black Caps were one of the prospects to win the tournament and had done exceptionally well. However, the batting fell apart in front a Mustafizur-led Bangladesh bowling. The bowler removed Henry Nicholls early in the match. Skipper Kane Williamson went on to build a brief partnership with Collin Munro but departed scoring 42, getting bowled off a Mustafizur-off-cutter. He later on removed Grant Elliott and New Zealand posted a challenge of 146 runs. Bangladesh batsmen failed to follow the performance up with a good batting performance and eventually lost the match by 75 runs. In the tournament, he picked 9 wickets at 9.55 and economy rate of just over seven. Mustafizur’s brilliant performance in the international circuit helped him get picked for Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), who eventually went on to win the league. Mustafizur finished the season with 17 wickets in hand as the fifth-highest wicket-taker of the league. Among his wickets were Shane Watson and AB de Villiers. Fizz bagged 17 wickets in the tournament at 24.76 and his economy rate was only 6.90. Mustafizur was also picked by Sussex to play in the NatWest T20 Blast. Playing against Essex, the bowler took a 4-for on his debut and his wickets included Ravi Bopara and Ryan ten Doeschate.   আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman, celebrating his 21st birthday today, has become quite a popular figure in the international cricket community in his short career by dint of his awesome talent and his appearances in the Indian Premier League. His performances for eventual champions Sunrisers Hyderabad have endeared him to the team management and particularly his captain David Warner. The explosive Australian opener took an immediate liking to the soft-spoken youngster who had won him many matches with his death-overs bowling. And, to the delight of Bangladeshi cricket fans, Warner even went the extra mile of learning a few phrases in Bangla to communicate with his trump card, whose facility with English lagged far behind his expertise with ball in hand. That foray into Bangla seems to have stayed with the Australian firebrand as the following tweet to Mustafizur shows:   Mustafizur is currently recovering from the shoulder surgery he underwent in England last month.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"According to Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan, cricket is probably the sport where the the role of a captain is most essential in determining the fate of his team. During a cricket match, the captain calls all the shots and has to get his message across to his teammates in the heat of battle. Considering the language barrier between Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper David Warner and Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman, it is even more remarkable how Fizz has fused so seamlessly with his newest team in a setting rather alien to the shy 20-year-old from Sathkhira. Hyderabad captain David Warner has admitted that he has an extraordinary talent on his hands in Mustafizur, but communicating with the star rookie has proved quite a handful for the Australian cricketer! Along with his use of Google translate, Warner has revealed that he is also taking help from a friend back home who can speak Bangla. Read more: 'Bowling no problem, but speaking and batting problem' ""It comes before the game: Google Translate,"" Warner said with a smile when asked how he communicates with his young star.""And I've got a friend at home who speaks Bangla, so I get him to text me a little bit,"" reports cricket.com.au ""But when you're out on the field he knows what he's got to do and he sets his field. If I disagree with one of his field placements, it's pretty easy to communicate."" Hyderabad captain added. Also read: MAGICAL Mustafizur The latest cricketing sensation from Bangladesh made the cricketing world sit up and take notice when he took 11 wickets in his first two one-day matches to give Tigers their maiden series win over India. Indian batting stalwarts like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina were all at sixes and sevens facing the barrage of mystical cutters from Mustafizur. Mustafizur has been rocking to the core in 20-over cricket, and played an important role in Bangladesh's campaigns at the recently concluded Asia Cup and ICC World T20 2016 in India. Currently, Fizz is ranked the 19th best T20 bowler in the world by the ICC, having played only 13 T20I matches. READ more: Relive the dream spell of Mustafizur Rahman In terms of making an impression, Mustafizur has been nothing short of magical with the white ball, and has proved his brilliance in five consecutive IPL games. In Hyderabad's win over Punjab, Fizz's incredible performance at the death earned him the man-of-the-match award as well as rave reviews from his teammates. The pacer's incredible figures of 2 for 9 in four overs helped restrict Punjab to 143 in the first innings which the Surisers chased down comfortably with 13 balls left. Also READ: Watch Fizz get Jaddu Warner was all smug with his star performer, and praised him to the skies during his captain's interview at the post-match presentation ceremony. A sign of how close he was with his new teammate was that Warner was attentive of the uneasiness that the usually ever-smiling Mustafizur was undergoing right then during the presentation ceremony. For the record, Fizz bowled his first maiden over in T20 cricket, the first in this year's IPL, had the lowest economy rate ever in an innings after three overs in the IPL by conceding only three runs. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Shubman Gill smashed a career-best 128 and Virat Kohli regained his form to fuel India's robust reply to Australia's first innings total of 480 on day three of the fourth and final Test in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Opener Gill, playing his second match of the series, featured in three 50-plus partnerships to help India, who lead the series 2-1, reach 289-3 at stumps. Kohli was batting on 59, his first Test half-century in 16 innings, with Ravindra Jadeja on 16 at the other end and India still 191 behind. ""Hopefully we'll bat well tomorrow and get some big score for us, and then you know anything can happen on day five,"" Gill told the broadcasters. ""Hopefully, the wicket will help our bowlers and if it does, we'll be trying to win this match."" ""The pitch was pretty good to bat on... It was important for us to bat big and keep picking the singles whenever possible."" Both Gill and Rohit Sharma signalled their attacking intent after India resumed on 36 for no loss at the Narendra Modi Stadium, which presented the best batting conditions so far in the series. Gill stamped his class with an exquisite cover drive against Mitchell Starc, while Rohit disdainfully pulled the left-arm quick for a six as India reached the 50-mark in the 13th over. Left-arm spinner Matt Kuhnemann broke the 74-run opening stand when Rohit's backfoot punch went straight to Marnus Labuschagne at short extra cover. Rohit, who made 35, left shaking his head after failing to convert the start into a big knock in perfect batting conditions. Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara consolidated India's position even though runs were not easy to come by in the second session. On a hot day, Australia captain Steve Smith used his quicks in short bursts and often tinkered with field setting to stem the flow of boundaries. The run-rate plummeted and India endured a 16-over boundary drought which Gill eventually ended with back-to-back fours off Cameron Green. The opener brought up his hundred with a four off Todd Murphy before bowing to the applauding crowd in celebration. Murphy tasted success with the final delivery of that over when Pujara fell lbw for 42. Gill started cramping up towards the end and was trapped lbw by Nathan Lyon after playing a tired-looking shot and missing the ball. India need to win the match to seal their place in the final of the World Test Championship against Australia at The Oval in June. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It was inevitable. More than it being a question of if, it was rather a debate over how and when. And, the answers to those last two questions were befitting the awe-inspiring personality that is Virat Kohli as he ascended the highest pedestal in ODIs in the most cinematic way on Wednesday. With his cricketing idol, Sachin Tendulkar, present and applauding from the stands of his home ground, the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Kohli bowed down as he surpassed the India legend's 49 ODI hundreds. The record 50th ODI ton from Kohli ensured the continuation of India's marauding run -- powering them to the highest-ever total recorded in a World Cup knockout game, resulting in a convincing win to see the 1983 and 2011 champions to their fourth World Cup final. Even long before Wednesday's milestone -- which is one of many from the perennial record-breaker Kohli -- the right-handed batter had been crowned the best in the business in the modern era. And rightly so, as Kohli remains only one of the few in modern cricket who will be the first pick for any eleven -- regardless of formats. His 117 on Wednesday was not the smoothest. In fact, his World Cup 2023 aggregate of 711 at a staggering 101.57 average -- the highest-ever by any batter in one edition of the showpiece event -- has seen more than a fair share of wobbles as Kohli was dropped a number of times throughout the tournament. It is only logical that when you are that good, your every move is scrutinised to the tiniest detail. With not many to be compared to, you are measured against the standards that you have set. But despite having millions of eyes set on you, many of which are intrigued to question the slightest of inaccuracies, it is the ability to shrug off those periods of shakiness to emerge as a hero, almost on every occasion, that acts as the true mark of a champion. And none better than Kohli owns the trait of a champion. He celebrates every century as his first. The pump of the fist after completing the doubles or the enthusiastic cheer after every wicket that his team takes only demonstrates the hunger that the 35-year-old still has even after a decade of dominance on the 22 yards. And for everything he does on the field, the aura that he exudes remains spellbinding. So much so that even his opposition turns into an admirer. ""I mean he's the best, isn't he? And he seems to be getting better, which is a worry for the opposition all around the world,"" said losing New Zealand captain Kane Williamson after the game. The warning that Williamson gave will probably hold true. Perhaps the world is yet to see the best version of Kohli as his dedication on the field is only matched by his resolve and astuteness off it. ""Honestly, it is going to mean nothing in 15-20 years,"" he had said after equalling Don Bradman's record of 29 Test centuries in a game against the West Indies in July this year. Maybe that's where Kohli is wrong because the astounding part of his 50th ODI ton remains the pace at which he had gotten there. As opposed to Tendulkar getting to his 49th ODI ton in his 451st innings, Kohli did one better and reached the milestone only in his 277th innings. If his pace of breaking records and setting new ones is cumulated with his hunger and determination, the milestones Kohli probably is going to set will not only be remembered for the next 15-20 years but cherished, admired, and aspired to for centuries. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Virat Kohli marked his 35th birthday with his second century of the World Cup and Ravindra Jadeja claimed five wickets as India thumped South Africa by 243 runs in a contest featuring the top two teams in the tournament at the Eden Gardens on Sunday. South Africa's chase of 327 began shakily as they lost half their side cheaply for 40 runs inside 14 overs as Jadeja (5-33) and Mohammed Shami (2-18) wreaked havoc before the Proteas fell to only their second defeat, dismissed for 83 in 27.1 overs. Jadeja was the pick of the bowlers, shattering the stumps of three batsmen, while Mohammed Siraj (1-11) and Kuldeep Yadav (2-7) also played their part in the big win. Kohli's unbeaten 101 contained 10 fours and left him level with Indian great Sachin Tendulkar on 49 one-day international hundreds as he continued his superb form by taking his tally past 500 runs in the tournament. He dropped anchor in a solid third-wicket stand of 134 with Shreyas Iyer, who hit 77 with seven fours and two sixes, before making his ton in the 49th over as India finished with 326-5 on a slow Kolkata wicketwith late hitting by Jadeja (29 not out). Both teams have qualified for the semi-finals and Sunday's game was touted as a dress rehearsal for the title clash later this month and it was India who took control early and set up their eighth successive victory. They elected to bat first after winning the toss and took advantage of some wayward pace bowling by Marco Jansen to make a blazing start but skipper Rohit Sharma fell for a 24-ball 40 as he looked to launch first-change Kagiso Rabada over mid-off. After reaching 91-1 in the powerplay, the hosts lost opener Shubman Gill (23) to an unplayable delivery from Keshav Maharaj in the 11th over as South Africa brought the run-rate under control with spin. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara said Thursday that ""shutting out the noise"" through yoga and meditation was his secret to having made it to his milestone 100th Test. The 35-year-old will be the 13th Indian cricketer to play a century of Tests when he takes to the field against Australia in New Delhi. ""When I made my debut I never thought about playing 100 Test matches and it's always about the present,"" Pujara told reporters on the eve of the Test. ""Hundred Tests is something that happens in a journey and something you can't predict, but once you continue playing good cricket, it happens."" Pujara is a rare five-day specialist in the age of Twenty20 and white-ball performers, opting out of the lucrative Indian Premier League auctions last year to play the English County Championship. India hammered Australia in the series opener at Nagpur by an innings inside three days, although Pujara made only seven runs before falling to off-spin debutant Todd Murphy. But the batsman has enjoyed remarkable longevity since his 2010 debut against Australia at home, averaging over 44 and making 19 centuries. Pujara attributed his staying power to discipline, especially because his single-format strengths leave long interludes between matches. ""I have certain routines, fitness, little bit of meditation, yoga and pranayama (a breathing technique) because it is necessary to shut the outside noise, even it if is positive. ""We play nine Tests on an average and when you go back home, unless you have domestic cricket, you are not in touch with the game. Keep challenging yourself, keep training, looking forward."" - 'Not someone who talks back' - Despite only five ODI appearances and a stop-start Test career Pujara said he had been able to finesse his style over the years. ""I can't change my game but obviously you can fine-tune and add things,"" he said. ""I have added a few shots to my game in the last couple of years and continuing to grow as a cricketer."" Pujara picked out England's Jimmy Anderson and Australia skipper Pat Cummins as among the best bowlers he has faced. He rated Australia, England and New Zealand as ""tough oppositions"" and praised the Australians for their ""good fighting spirit"". ""They would always challenge you as opponents, I had never had easy runs versus Australia,"" Pujara said. ""Always had to work hard for those runs and always banter and chat going on, sometimes it motivates me as I am not someone who talks back. ""I let the bat do the talking."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Opener Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara hit sublime centuries to put India in command of the second Test against Sri Lanka, as the hosts took a 107-run lead on Saturday's day two. The overnight batsmen put together a 209-run partnership to pulverise the opposition attack after the hosts started the day on 11-1 in response to Sri Lanka's 205. India were 312 for two at stumps in their first innings with Pujara, on 121, and skipper Virat Kohli, on 54, batting to push the visitors out of the game. Vijay, who made an impressive return to the team after a long injury lay-off, registered his 10th Test ton before falling to Rangana Herath in the final session of play. The right-handed opener gifted his wicket to the veteran left-arm spinner after mistiming his sweep on a full toss to short fine leg where Dilruwan Perera made no mistake. Perera had dropped Vijay on 61 at short mid-on off paceman Lahiru Gamage and the spill proved costly for the visitors who managed only one wicket in the day. Vijay and Pujara made sure India ram home the advantage from day one as they recorded their fifth century stand in their last seven Test innings together. Vijay, who replaced Shikhar Dhawan in the starting lineup after the left-handed opener pulled out due to personal reasons, hit 11 fours and a six during his 221-ball knock. Pujara played the sheet anchor's role to perfection and took control after the fall of his overnight partner to record his 14th Test century. Pujara, a classical batsman who passed 1,000 Test runs this year, played a sedate knock to frustrate the bowlers on a gruelling day for Sri Lanka on the field. He also combined with Kohli for an unbeaten 96-run stand, forcing skipper Dinesh Chandimal to continue juggling his bowling options till the end of day. Kohli hit a 66-ball half-century and had smashed six boundaries so far. The top-ranked India are looking to go one-up in the three-Test series after the first match ended in a draw in Kolkata. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A top Sri Lanka cricket official quit Sunday after the country's sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe called for the cricket board to resign, accusing them of corruption following a record World Cup defeat Secretary of Sri Lanka Cricket, Mohan de Silva, the board's second highest ranking official, told AFP that he had sent his resignation from Australia where he had been diagnosed with a heart condition. Sri Lanka's humiliating 302-run World Cup thrashing by hosts India last week prompted a public outcry with Ranasinghe saying the Sri Lanka Cricket officials had no moral or ethical right to remain in office. ""They should voluntarily resign,"" he said. De Silva said he had been diagnosed during a routine medical check-up in Australia and decided to resign from his elected position on the board. He said his medical condition was ""obviously due to the stress and anxiety surrounding controversies in cricket,"" adding his family had asked him to step down. Sri Lanka were at one point 14-6 and were all out for 55, the fourth-lowest World Cup total in history, while chasing India's 358 in Mumbai on Thursday. On Saturday Ranasinghe wrote to full members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) asking for their understanding and support. ""Sri Lanka Cricket has been besieged with complaints of player disciplinary issues, management corruption, financial misconduct, and match-fixing allegations,"" Ranasinghe said in the letters, released to Sri Lankan media. The minister was forced by the ICC to withdraw a three-member panel he had appointed last month to investigate corruption at the board after it was deemed to be political interference. Board sources said coaching staff had been called to explain the crushing defeat to India. Sri Lanka have not won the World Cup since 1996, with Ranasinghe blaming the board for the ""deterioration"" of standards. Another cabinet minister, Prasanna Ranatunga who is the brother of World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, told parliament in August that the 1996 victory had been ""the biggest curse for our cricket."" ""Money started flowing to the cricket board after 1996 and with that came those who wanted to steal,"" he said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Anger over Sri Lanka's miserable World Cup campaign has erupted after a humiliating 302-run thrashing by hosts India, with the island nation's sports minister demanding the cricket board's resignation. Sri Lanka were dismissed for 55 while chasing 358 in Mumbai on Thursday, the fourth-lowest total at a World Cup tournament. Sports minister Roshan Fernando, who has long been at loggerheads with the board and previously accused it of being ""traitorous and corrupt"", upped the stakes by telling officials and selectors to quit. ""Sri Lanka Cricket officials have no moral or ethical right to remain in office,"" the minister said in a statement issued on Friday night. ""They should voluntarily resign."" Local newspapers echoed Fernando's dismay with mass daily Lankadeepa on Saturday writing that explanations were needed from coaching staff over the ""heart-wrenching defeat"". ""SACK THEM ALL,"" screamed the front-page headline of the Daily Mirror, in reference to the board. There was no immediate formal comment from Sri Lanka Cricket, but board officials said it had sought an explanation from coaching staff over the crushing defeat. Sri Lanka has not won the Cricket World Cup since its sole victory in 1996, with Fernando blaming the board for the ""deterioration"" of standards since then. Another cabinet minister, Prasanna Ranatunga, told parliament in August that Sri Lanka's win turned out to be a ""curse"" in disguise that fostered a culture of corruption spanning decades. ""The World Cup victory was the biggest curse for our cricket,"" said Ranatunga, the younger brother of Arjuna Ranatunga, who skippered Sri Lanka to victory that year.

"Hardik Pandya has been traded to his former franchise Mumbai Indians from Gujarat Titans with Cameron Green moving from Mumbai to Royal Challengers Bangalore, the IPL said on Monday. Five-time winners Mumbai got all-rounder Pandya back on his existing player fee of $1.8 million as teams prepare their wish lists and organise their purses for the IPL auction on December 19 in Dubai. Pandya first joined Mumbai, which is owned by Nita Ambani -- wife of India's richest man, the Reliance Industries billionaire Mukesh Ambani -- as an uncapped player in 2015 for $11,000. ""We are thrilled to welcome Hardik back home! It's a heartwarming reunion with our Mumbai Indians family!,"" Nita Ambani said in a statement. ""From being a young scouted talent of Mumbai Indians to now being a Team India star, Hardik has come a long way and we're excited for what the future holds for him and Mumbai Indians."" An attacking batsman and fast bowler, Pandya led Gujarat to the IPL title in their debut season in 2022 and remained captain in their runners-up finish this year. He led from the front with 833 runs in 30 innings and a strike rate of 133.49. Pandya took 11 wickets. India opener Shubman Gill has been named captain of Gujarat ahead of the 2024 season. ""Shubman Gill has shown growth in stature and standing over the last two years at the highest level of the game,"" said Vikram Solanki, Gujarat's director of cricket. ""We've seen him mature not only as a batter but also as a leader in cricket."" Mumbai let go of Australian all-rounder Green, who was the second most expensive buy in the auction for the 2023 season at $2.11 million. Green had an impressive start to the IPL, hitting an unbeaten century and two half-centuries. He took six wickets with his pace bowling. Green, 24, joins Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis at Bangalore, who are still hunting a maiden IPL title. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"With his appetite for wickets and hard-hitting batting, Hardik Pandya has come back from controversies and injuries to become India's go-to all-rounder ahead of this year's Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. Pandya stood calm with an unbeaten 33 and hit the winning six in the final over of a tense pursuit of 148 to beat arch-rivals Pakistan and begin the Asia Cup T20 tournament on a high on Sunday. With the ball in hand earlier, he took 3-25 as he and fellow pace bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar shared seven wickets to set up the victory chase at a packed Dubai International Stadium. The Indian Express newspaper called him the ""New cool king in town"" and veteran commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted there are ""few better than him in this format"". Pandya's performance comes as no surprise after he returned from a back injury to lead Indian Premier League debutants Gujarat Titans to a fairytale title in May. The 28-year-old flamboyant cricketer who loves his tattoos and expensive watches, had once said he likes to live life ""kingsize"". From the western state of Gujarat, Pandya was in 2019 suspended for sexist comments on a TV show and written off as a brash cricketer. But he has defied critics with his on-field performances to reward the faith shown in him by the India team management. ""Grateful that we are getting this opportunity and we are able to do this because our process is just not for this but for the upcoming World Cup,"" Pandya told India's cricket board website after the five-wicket win. ""If we get another such situation, definitely we will remember this match."" He added he had felt ""no pressure"" when India needed seven off the last over, even though when Pandya hit the winning six off left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz there were just two balls to spare. - Beautiful journey - ""The way he has batted and bowled in the last few series, I will pray that he performs like this in the World Cup and it will be good for us,"" said Kumar, who took four wickets. Pandya put on a key fifth-wicket stand with Ravindra Jadeja as life came full circle for the player who was stretchered off the field at the same venue in a 2018 Asia Cup group match against Pakistan. It was the start of Pandya's struggle with a back injury, which forced him to play mainly as a batsman in last year's T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. ""I remembered it all. I was going out on a stretcher and it was the same dressing room,"" Pandya said. ""I feel a sense of achievement because of how things unfolded and the way I got this opportunity. ""The journey has been beautiful and we get the fruits but I think credit should be given to behind-the-scenes guys (physiotherapist) Nitin Patel and (strength and training coach) Soham Desai."" India' cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar tweeted: ""It came down to fitness of the fast bowlers while put under pressure, though both teams' pacers bowled well up front. ""Crucial knock by Hardik to stay till the end & get us over the line & ably supported by @imjadeja & Virat. Congrats on a nail-biting win."" Pandya proved his fitness in this year's IPL with 487 runs and eight wickets in 15 matches which earned him a recall for June's Twenty20 series against South Africa. After 66 one-day internationals and 68 Twenty20 matches, a fit and firing Pandya seems to have ended India's long-time hunt for a world-class all-rounder. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic demolished Alex de Minaur for the loss of just five games to sweep into a 13th Australian Open quarter-final and send an ominous warning Monday, showing few signs of his troublesome hamstring. Player-turned commentator Jelena Dokic lashed out Monday at the ""disgusting"" body-shaming she has endured online while working at the Australian Open. World number two Rafael Nadal slumped to a second-straight defeat at the United Cup Monday in a setback to his Australian Open preparations, but Stefanos Tsitsipas and Iga Swiatek were both on song. The much-awaited Women’s Asia Cup, played in the 20-over format since 2012, returns with its eighth edition in Sylhet as the curtain-raiser sees defending champions Bangladesh take on Thailand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium Ground 2 (SICS Outer) today from Bangladesh Standard Time 9:00 am. Pakistan coach Saqlain Mushtaq defended his team's Twenty20 playing style after losing Sunday's Asia Cup final, saying they were on the right track for next month's T20 World Cup. Dasun Shanaka's Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 23 runs in Dubai on Sunday to clinch their sixth Asia Cup. Bhanuka Rajapaksa on Sunday said Sri Lanka's cricket has proved a point to the world with their sixth Asia Cup title after his unbeaten 71 set up a commanding 23-run win over Pakistan. Skipper Dasun Shanaka on Sunday called the Asia Cup triumph a ""real turnaround"" for Sri Lankan cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup and dedicated the win to the crisis-hit nation. 'It was a team effort,' a very proud Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said after his side's Asia Cup triumph on Sunday. Sri Lanka won their sixth Asia Cup title as the Dasun Shanaka-led side handed a 23-run defeat to Pakistan in the final of the Asia Cup in Dubai tonight. Bhanuka Rajapaksa smashed an unbeaten 71 to guide Sri Lanka to 170-6 after Pakistan's Haris Rauf rattled the opposition with early wickets in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. As the five-time Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka are set to battle it out against two-time winners Pakistan in the final of the continental tournament’s 15th edition in Dubai tonight at 8:00pm Bangladesh Standard Time, the task of picking the favourites on paper becomes virtually impossible. Sri Lanka exude confidence at the moment, having secured four back-to-back victories that begun with the win over Bangladesh. They geared for the final with a win in the dead-rubber Super Four stage game against Pakistan in what was a dress rehearsal for the final. Their plans have been like clockwork, especially with the bat. In Dubai, the centre-stage for the Pakistan-Sri Lanka final today, there was no intense media activity with both teams having opted to stay within their hotel, foregoing practice sessions and media conference. Bangladeshi umpire Masudur Rahman Mukul will be conducting the Aisa Cup final between Pakistan and Sri Lanka on Sunday as one of the two on-field umpires. Sri Lanka are poised for an unlikely Asia Cup victory over favourites Pakistan in Sunday's final after a giant-slaying streak through the tournament despite troubles at home. Spinner Wanindu Hasaranga led Sri Lanka’s bowling charge to set up a comfortable five-wicket victory over Pakistan on Friday in their dress rehearsal for the Asia Cup final. When it comes to death-over bowling, the 2022 Asia Cup has seen pretty sub-par performances from a few bowlers. Pakistan’s Harris Rauf and India’s Arshdeep Singh have been the most reliable names in the tournament, but in general, runs have been leaked and the biggest boost it has given is to batters who played the role of finisher in the T20 event.

"Novak Djokovic demolished Alex de Minaur for the loss of just five games to sweep into a 13th Australian Open quarter-final and send an ominous warning Monday, showing few signs of his troublesome hamstring. The Serbian brushed past the Australian 22nd seed 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena to move a step closer to a 10th title at Melbourne Park, and 22 major crown. With his left thigh again heavily strapped, the 35-year-old was a man on a mission, expending as little energy as possible in a 2hrs 6mins romp to inch within sight of Rafael Nadal's slam record. He will meet fifth seed Andrey Rublev for a semi-final berth after the Russian toppled Danish teen Holger Rune in a tense five-set clash on the same court. ""I really wanted to win in straight sets,"" said Djokovic, who will return to world number one for the first time since June if he wins the tournament. ""Obviously you never know what's going to happen on the court ... I thought first four or five games were quite close, but after one break in the first set I felt more loose and free to go through the ball and be more aggressive. ""I played the best match of this year so far."" Victory put him into a 13th Melbourne quarter-final to move fourth on the all-time list behind Roger Federer, Nadal and John Newcombe. It is his 54th Grand Slam quarter-final in total -- second only to the retired Federer's 58. De Minaur, who recorded his first victory against a top-five player in November when he beat Daniil Medvedev at the Paris Masters, was always facing an uphill climb. Djokovic has not lost in Melbourne since 2018 -- he did not play in 2022 -- and has now won 25 consecutive matches at the Australian Open. He always had the measure of the young Australian and broke to love in game six, consolidating without dropping a point for 5-2. With de Minaur struggling under the pressure, he sent a baseline forehand long to hand the Serb another break and the set in just 35 minutes. Only 54 percent of De Minaur's first serves went in compared to Djokovic's 76 percent, with the winners 9-1 in favour of the dominant Serb. De Minaur won the sixth game in the second set, ending a run of nine consecutive losses, but it was only a brief moment of respite. Djokovic stretched his hamstring at the changeover and immediately applied pressure again on De Minaur's first service game to break again in the third set, all but ending the match. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic closed in on a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title on Saturday after sweeping past Carlos Alcaraz 6-3, 6-2 in a dominating semi-final display he hailed as his best of the tournament. Carlos Alcaraz is dreaming of victory at the ATP Finals after setting up a semi-final showdown with Novak Djokovic with Friday's 6-4, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev. World number one Novak Djokovic beat ATP Finals alternate Hubert Hurkacz 7-6(1) 4-6 6-1 in their Green Group clash on Thursday and advanced to the semi-finals after Jannik Sinner edged Holger Rune 6-2 5-7 6-4 in the evening match. Russian Zverev put on a powerful display to see off world number two. The 24-time Grand Slam champion needed just one win or a defeat for young rival Carlos Alcaraz in order to secure top spot in the ATP rankings for 2023 and prevailed in a three-hour Green Group clash with spirited debutant Rune. The 36-year-old Djokovic eclipsed his previous record set two years ago as the tournament's oldest champion, capturing his 40th Masters 1000 title and stretching his winning run to 18 matches. Novak Djokovic rallied to defeat Andrey Rublev 5-7, 7-6 (7/3), 7-5 in a gripping Paris Masters semi-final on Saturday, earning a shot at a record-extending seventh title in the final against Grigor Dimitrov. ""It's very tough seeing children, babies dying every day,"" she said. Djokovic will spearhead Serbia at the tournament from December 29-January 7 in Sydney and Perth as he builds towards the defence of his Australian Open title. The world number two said he had been ""out of my mind"" during his semi-final match against Jannik Sinner in the Chinese capital, which the Italian won 7-6 (7/4), 6-1. ","sports"
"Nick Kyrgios said he is ""thankful"" to Andy Murray for looking out for him after he spotted signs of self-harm on the Australian's body. Former tennis world number one Rafael Nadal will return at the Brisbane International warm up event for the Australian Open in January, the Spaniard said on Friday. Novak Djokovic said he accepts responsibility for Serbia's Davis Cup semi-final defeat by Italy on Saturday after failing to convert three match points against Jannik Sinner. At 36 years old Djokovic is still tennis' number one player by some distance and he has racked up a host of new records this season, taking his Grand Slam tally to 24 and finishing top of the year-end world rankings for the eighth time. Novak Djokovic closed in on a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title on Saturday after sweeping past Carlos Alcaraz 6-3, 6-2 in a dominating semi-final display he hailed as his best of the tournament. Meanwhile, Ruman Sana and Diya Siddique suffered elimination from their respective events. Alex de Minaur guided Australia into a second successive Davis Cup final with an assured 2-0 win over Finland on Friday in Malaga. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) president Morinari Watanabe pledged their support to the Bangladesh Gymnastics Federation (BGF) to help achieve its goal of winning an Olympic medal in the 2028 Games after attending its development committee meeting in Dhaka yesterday. Djokovic was enraged as some fans tried to drown out his victory speech with drums, which the superstar said he felt he had to respond to. Organisers said nearly 70,000 of these newly released tickets would cost 24 euros ($26), the lowest price category of any of the tickets sold for the Games. Ronnie O'Sullivan has warned he will quit snooker if he is restricted from playing non-tour events in China, saying his career is at a ""crossroads"". Serbia are one of the eight surviving nations from September's group phase and will face Britain on Thursday. ""It's very tough seeing children, babies dying every day,"" she said. Starting from third on the grid, the Red Bull driver stole the lead at the start and then dominated the race, which was punctuated by a lengthy red flag stoppage when Kevin Magnussen crashed heavily in his Haas. Spain's Jorge Martin won a thrilling Thailand MotoGP race Sunday to close the gap on Francesco Bagnaia in the world championship race. South Africa produced a magnificent defensive display to edge 14-man New Zealand 12-11 in an arm-wrestle of a Rugby World Cup final on Saturday and win the Webb Ellis Cup for a record fourth time.

"Nick Kyrgios said he is ""thankful"" to Andy Murray for looking out for him after he spotted signs of self-harm on the Australian's body. The 28-year-old has previously opened up about the mental health struggles he has battled throughout his career and in June revealed in a Netflix documentary he had spent time in a psychiatric hospital after losing at Wimbledon in 2019. ""Andy was always a big supporter of me,"" Kyrgios said in an interview with Piers Morgan Uncensored on TalkTV. ""As soon as I came on the tour, he kind of saw a work in progress and took me under his wing. ""Then he realised later in my career that I don't think I was coachable or I was on my own path, but he was always someone that was looking out for me. ""He saw it (the self-harm), and he said, 'What's that on your arm?' It was pretty bad at that stage. Andy obviously was trying to give me advice on it. But I was just so stuck in my ways at that time that I didn't listen. ""Obviously I'm very thankful. I thank him a lot."" Kyrgios wrote a lengthy Instagram post in February last year about his mental health struggles, at the end of which he said he was in a much better place. Currently sidelined through injury, the Australian said he feels proud for being able to help people who are having mental health issues. ""I've almost been a beacon for people who are struggling,"" he added. ""When they feel like they're overwhelmed and they're going towards drinking, drugs and stuff, they open up and they feel like I'm relatable,"" Kyrgios said. ""That's been the most powerful thing in my career, people coming to me with genuine issues."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Andy Murray stunned Italian 13th seed Matteo Berrettini on Tuesday, saving a match point to prevail over five gruelling sets and book a spot in the Australian Open second round. The three-time Grand Slam champion has battled major hip and abdominal injuries for half a decade but declared himself free of pain and fired up before the tournament. His renowned grit was on full display in toppling the Italian 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (7/9), 7-6 (10/6) in 4hrs 49mins under a closed roof on Rod Laver Arena due to extreme heat. It was a huge win for the 35-year-old Briton, now ranked 66, to knock out last year's semi-finalist for a landmark 50th match-win at the season-opening Grand Slam. ""I'll be feeling this this evening and tomorrow, but right now I'm unbelievably happy and proud of myself,"" said Murray, a five-time runner-up at Melbourne Park. ""I've put a lot of work into the last few months with my team to give me this opportunity to perform on stadiums like this, in matches like this and against players like Matteo and it paid off tonight."" It was Murray's first victory over a top 20 player at a Grand Slam since defeating ninth-ranked Kei Nishikori in the quarter-finals of the 2017 French Open. Victory also brought up his 50th Australian Open match-win, becoming only the fifth man in the Open Era to achieve the feat alongside Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Stefan Edberg. ""I think some of the tennis at the end was really good, it felt like that playing,"" he said. ""He's a brilliant competitor, one of the best on tour, he always fights to the end and I did well to get through."" Coached by Ivan Lendl, who won the Melbourne Park title in 1989 and 1990, Murray broke once in the first set and twice in the second as the Italian struggled on his second serve while making a slew of unforced errors. But Berrettini rallied in the third set with a break to move 3-2 clear and helped by six aces took it to a fourth set. Nothing separated them and it went to a seesawing tiebreak that the Italian won on his third set point when Murray sent a forehand long. Berrettini earned a match point 5-4 in the fifth, but netted an easy half-volley to waste the opportunity and it again went to a tiebreak where an early break for Murray gave him the edge and he clung on. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Australian Open set a Grand Slam attendance record with more than 900,000 spectators visiting over three weeks, organisers said on Tuesday, despite the absence of some big-name players and schedule disruptions due to rain. A record 839,192 fans flocked to Melbourne Park from Jan. 16-29 for the first tournament in two years free of COVID-19 restrictions, beating the previous mark of 812,174 set in January 2020. The figures eclipse last year's attendance numbers at other Grand Slam main draws - 515,164 visited Wimbledon, 613,500 were at the French Open and 776,120 went to the U.S. Open. Over 60,000 also watched the qualifying events in Melbourne, bringing the total up to 902,312. The tournament, missing the retired Serena Williams, Roger Federer and last year's homegrown champion Ash Barty, broke its single-day attendance mark with 94,854 fans visiting on Jan. 21. The previous record was 93,709 set in 2020. ""It was reported that we didn't have the greats any more, that it was going to be terrible. But people just want to be entertained,"" Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley told the Melbourne Age. ""They want to have some fun, and tennis is a great option for them, and it's become a summer thing to do for Melburnians and for Australians and also for our guests from around the world."" Tiley has set his sights on breaching the one million mark next year. ""This year was the start of it,"" Tiley said. ""It's going to be a three-week extravaganza.""

"Big-serving Elena Rybakina blasted her way into the Australian Open semi-finals on Tuesday, while Karen Khachanov followed suit in the men's draw after Sebastian Korda suffered a wrist injury. In the first quarter-final on day nine at Melbourne Park, Moscow-born Kazakh Rybakina stepped up her bid for a second Grand Slam title with a ruthless 6-2, 6-4 win over Jelena Ostapenko. She will face American third seed Jessica Pegula or two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka in the last four. The 23-year-old Rybakina sent down 11 aces to blow former French Open champion Ostapenko off Rod Laver Arena in 79 minutes. The 22nd seed has blasted 35 aces so far, more than any other woman at the tournament. Ominously, she said her serve is better now than when she won Wimbledon last year. ""I gained even more power. It's my weapon on the court and of course we are trying to work on it,"" she said, before adding: ""Always a lot to improve."" The first men's quarter-final had been warming up nicely until Korda hurt his wrist against Russia's Khachanov. The 18th seed went through when the young American retired in the third set, down 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 3-0. Khachanov's reward is a clash with either Greek third seed Stefanos Tsitsipas or unseeded Czech Jiri Lehecka, who play later, for a spot in Sunday's final. Tsitsipas is the highest remaining seed in the draw after a series of shock exits. The 22-year-old Korda, who had been attempting to emulate his father Petr's Australian Open victory in 1998, said afterwards that he could barely hold the racquet. He said he first felt the injury while playing the Adelaide International this month, where he made the final and forced a championship point before being beaten by Novak Djokovic. But it had not bothered him in the opening four rounds at Melbourne Park until he hit a return in the second set. ""I had it in Adelaide and then it went away completely. Now it just came back out of nowhere,"" he said. ""I have never had any wrist issues before. ""I knew kind of what it was right away, right when I hit the return. I kind of felt that spot that I was feeling before. ""Some forehands I couldn't even hold the racquet. Volleying was almost impossible for me, so it was a little tough."" For Khachanov it is a second consecutive Grand Slam semi-final, having reached the last four at the 2022 US Open. Nine-time Melbourne champion Djokovic is still on the scene, with a quarter-final against Russian fifth seed Andrey Rublev on Wednesday, but otherwise the draw has opened up. ""I'm feeling good, to be honest, and really happy about the way I'm competing,"" said Khachanov, ranked 20th in the world. ""I'm looking forward to the semi-finals here in Australia for the first time."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Ons Jabeur gained revenge for her defeat in last year's Wimbledon final on Wednesday, coming from behind to beat Elena Rybakina and reach the last four. In a repeat of the 2022 title match, the Tunisian sixth seed beat her third-ranked opponent 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-1 on Centre Court. The 28-year-old will face Belarusian second seed Aryna Sabalenka for a place in Saturday's final at the All England Club. ""I'm very happy with the performance -- a lot of emotion out there, especially playing someone that serves really well,"" she said. ""It's frustrating to return but I'm glad I did everything, shouted, got angry, then got calm and focused and hopefully I can manage my emotions like this for the next two matches."" Rybakina was first to pounce, breaking to love in the fourth game when Jabeur went wide with a backhand but the Tunisian hit back immediately. Jabeur took advantage of a loose volley at the net from Rybakina to break again and edge into a 6-5 lead. But this time she was the player who failed to consolidate, squandering a set point as Rybakina forced a tie-break, which she won. The Kazakh survived break points in the second game of the second set while Jabeur was forced to dig deep on her serve to move into a 3-2 lead. Both players held serve until the 10th game, when Rybakina cracked and Jabeur levelled the match. The force was with Jabeur in the decider as she opened up a 3-0 lead and saved two break points to move 4-1 ahead. Jabeur powered a backhand down the line to break once again and held her serve to seal the win, letting out a roar of delight. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"World number one Iga Swiatek rallied from a set down to beat Aryna Sabalenka 3-6 6-1 6-4 and reach her first US Open final, where she will meet Ons Jabeur on Saturday for the trophy. After a sluggish start, the Pole came alive in the second set and overcame an early break in the decider by winning the final four games to see off the powerful Belarusian. ""Against Aryna you have to have the energy to push her back and be able to play those fast balls,"" Swiatek said in an on-court interview. ""In the first set I lacked a little bit of that so I needed to get it together. Drink some energy shots and just kind of go with it. I'm pretty glad that I did that."" With the win Swiatek became the first Polish woman to ever reach the US Open final where she will face Jabeur, who became the first African woman of the Open era to do the same earlier in the day. Both Swiatek and Sabalenka came out tense under the lights on Thursday but the sixth seed settled in first, finding a service rhythm and dialing in her forehand against Swiatek, who has struggled at times in the past against big hitters. Sabalenka consolidated a break with an ace for 4-2 and captured the first set when she snuck to the net behind a huge forehand and sent a volley past the charging Swiatek. But Swiatek, who was forced to battle back from a set down in her fourth-round match against Jule Niemeier, raised her level in the second, serving much better and breaking Sabalenka three times to level the contest. Sabalenka responded early in the third, her confidence growing when her blistering backhand knocked her opponent backwards and onto the court as she raced out to a 2-0 lead. But the feisty Swiatek refused to give in, breaking back with a backhand winner to level at 4-4 and advanced to her first final in Flushing Meadows when Sabalenka's backhand landed in the net. The two-time French Open champion Swiatek will gun for her third Grand Slam title when she faces dynamic Tunisian Jabeur, who cruised to her semi-final with a straight sets win over Caroline Garcia. Swiatek and Jabeur are 2-2 in their four career meetings. ""It's always tough and I'm pretty sure it's going to be physical,"" Swiatek said of Jabeur. ""She has such good hands, she is solid on the baseline and when she's going in so I have to be careful. ""I don't know what's going to happen. Right now, I'm just going to enjoy being in the final."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"World number one Iga Swiatek defeated American Jessica Pegula 6-3, 6-0 in just over an hour to defend her Qatar Open title on Saturday. The victory capped off a dominant campaign during which Swiatek recorded 6-0, 6-1 wins over both Danielle Collins and Veronika Kudermetova and received a quarter-final bye, dropping just five games in three matches. The reigning French and U.S. Open champion was quick to downplay the significance of her achievement, however, saying in an on-court interview, ""Well, for sure the bye helped. I don't really care how many games I won or lost."" It is Swiatek's first title of a year, and follows her shock fourth-round exit in the Australian Open at the hands of Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. The Pole will be hoping it helps kickstart a run similar to last year, when she built on her maiden victory in Doha to win 37 straight matches and claim the French Open as well as titles at Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Rome. ""I feel like I found my rhythm here after a tough beginning to the season,"" said Swiatek, after claiming her 12th WTA singles title. ""I could really stay focused from the beginning to the end of matches."" Swiatek lent her support to the people in Ukraine following her win in the last edition of the tournament, and reiterated that message on Saturday. ""I feel like we all have pretty short memories, but we should all support Ukraine and Ukrainians in everything they cope with every day,"" Swiatek said.

"Spanish tennis star Rafa Nadal reiterated Monday that finishing his career in 2024 remains his goal, while admitting he has taken two operations to try and heal his hip injury. ""I said that possibly 2024 was my last year, I maintain that, but I can not confirm it 100 percent because I do not know,"" Nadal told Movistar. The 37-year-old announced in May that the hip injury he suffered at the Australian Open in January meant he had to step away from the sport to try and come back stronger. Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam winner, reiterated on Monday that he ""would like to play again and be competitive again"". ""My hope is not to return to win Roland Garros or win (in) Australia, so that people are not confused, all that is a long way off,"" he said. ""I am well aware of the difficulties that I face, one is insurmountable, that is age, and the other are physical problems. ""What makes me hopeful is to play again, to be competitive again.""

"Novak Djokovic believes Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz possesses the ""best of all three worlds"", cloning the talents of himself, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. World number one Alcaraz defeated Djokovic 1-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 in the Wimbledon final on Sunday after four hours and 42 minutes of breathless action on Centre Court. The result shattered 36-year-old Djokovic's bid to claim a record-equalling eighth title at the All England Club and 24th Grand Slam crown. Asked what makes the 20-year-old Alcaraz such a threat, the Serb star explained that he has duplicated his weapons, as well as Federer and Nadal -- the storied 'big three' of tennis who between them have 65 Grand Slam titles. ""I think he's got basically best of all three worlds,"" said Djokovic. ""People have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa, and myself. I would agree with that."" Hailing Alcaraz for his ""Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness"", Djokovic sees similarities in the renowned fighting spirit and ""incredible defence"" of Nadal. Alcaraz's backhands are straight out of the Djokovic playbook. ""That's been my personal strength for many years,"" he said. ""I haven't played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own obviously strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is a very complete player. ""Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for successful career on all surfaces."" - 'Tough to swallow' - In the immediate aftermath of his loss on Sunday, Djokovic was full of praise for Alcaraz. Just last month, Djokovic defeated the Spaniard in the French Open semi-finals, with Alcaraz's challenge undermined by body cramping brought on by the stress of facing his rival. However, Alcaraz has now beaten Djokovic twice in their three meetings, having first got the better of him on clay at the Madrid Masters last year. ""What a quality at the end of the match when you had to serve it out,"" Djokovic told the champion during the Centre Court trophy ceremony. ""You can up with some big plays in the big situation and you absolutely deserve it. ""It's a tough one to swallow when you are so close."" Despite his defeat on Centre Court in 10 years, Djokovic, who had won the previous four Wimbledon titles, insisted he still has the desire to keep on chasing silverware at the majors. ""I've been blessed with so many incredible matches throughout my career. I'm really grateful. I lost to a better player and I have to move on stronger,"" he said after seeing his 34-match win streak at the tournament ended. He hailed Alcaraz, who now has two Grand Slam titles following his US Open breakthrough last year, and two titles on grass in just four tournaments on the surface. ""I thought I would have trouble with you only on clay and hard court, but not on grass but now it's a different story from this year obviously,"" said the Serb, who briefly broke down in tears as he addressed the crowd. ""I guess when all the emotions are settled I'll have to be very grateful. I won many tight and close matches in the past here, to name a few -- 2019 against Roger. ""Maybe I should have lost a few finals that I won so maybe this is even stevens."" The result ended Djokovic's hopes of attempting the first men's calendar Grand Slam since 1969, having won the Australian and French Opens this year. The last man to complete the sweep, Rod Laver, heaped praise on both men. ""Carlos Alcaraz....you certainly found your feet on grass this summer, an astonishing achievement against one of the greatest champions ever,"" the Australian tweeted. ""Novak Djokovic. I'm sure there will be many more magnificent battles between you two."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic stepped in to defend Carlos Alcaraz on Thursday for missing this week's Davis Cup matches, saying the 20-year-old Spaniard may be young but he's not Superman. Alcaraz pulled out of the final group stage after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the US Open semi-finals, saying he needed a rest. Spain could have done with the world number two when losing their opening Group C tie in Valencia 3-0 to the Czech Republic on Wednesday. Djokovic, whose Serbia face Spain on Friday, told the Spanish media in Valencia: ""Maybe you guys are upset he's not playing for Spain, because he's 20 years old and I'm 36, and how he's tired and I'm not. ""It's important to understand he's got a lot of time ahead of him."" Djokovic, who defeated Medvedev for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows, added: ""He already played for Spain last year, you can't forget that. ""He won the US Open last year and after a few days he was here playing for his heart and his passion for his country."" The world number one recalled the upset he triggered when choosing not to compete for Serbia in the annual men's team competition. ""I have skipped the Davis Cup several times, I know the backlash and reaction from my country was not so great and there's a lot of negativity when you skip playing for your country,"" he said. ""It's difficult to always be perfect and always available. We're part of an individual sport, you represent your country but also yourself and there's a lot of tournaments, and he has played a lot."" Djokovic added: ""Even though he's 20 years old, it doesn't mean he's a Superman. ""He needs to rest as well ... It's better for us, the Serbian team that he's not here, honestly, but I'm sure he'll be back and bring a lot of joy to Spain."" Djokovic was rested by Serbia's Davis Cup skipper Viktor Troicki for his country's opening 3-0 win against South Korea on Tuesday. But despite a long season he said he was ready to help Serbia's quest to qualify for the knockout finals in Malaga next month. ""I don't feel very fresh obviously after an exhausting several months with a lot of matches, but I think this is a positive tiredness for the success that I had in America. ""There's not much time to recover, I have to try and maintain the intensity and try to do everything I can to adapt my body and myself to the new time zone and new conditions and contribute to my country with the points."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic will finish the year as world number one for a record-extending eighth time after beating Holger Rune 7-6 (7/4), 6-7 (1/7), 6-3 in his opening match at the ATP Finals on Sunday. The 24-time Grand Slam champion needed just one win or a defeat for young rival Carlos Alcaraz in order to secure top spot in the ATP rankings for 2023 and prevailed in a three-hour Green Group clash with spirited debutant Rune. Djokovic, on a run of 19 straight wins, has had an age-defying year, winning three Slams to become the all-time record winner of major titles. The 36-year-old came into the Finals in Turin off the back of his seventh triumph at the Paris Masters, his 40th victory at a Masters 100 event. Those are two more records to add to a long and growing list for Djokovic, who is hunting a seventh Finals title which would take him one ahead of retired great Roger Federer. ""It means a lot. You could see that there were a lot of emotions on the court,"" said Djokovic. ""I could feel it, I was very eager to win the match and get that monkey off my back... Obviously a big objective, a big goal has been achieved, everything else now is a bonus."" Djokovic looked on course for victory when he took a brutal opening set in decisive fashion, prevailing in the tie-break with a stunning cross-court return winner. And the match looked to have turned decisively in the third game of the second set, when after Rune won the first two Djokovic broke back in a brilliant 11-point game eventually won at the third attempt. Rune kept plugging away, however, and after the pair slugged each other with bigger and bigger hits Djokovic slipped in the tie-break, missing a simple volley to draw level on the second point and then collapsing to concede the set. But after briefly losing it for allowing Rune to break back in game three of the third set, kicking his rackets in a rage, Djokovic composed himself and saw out a historic win. ""I found a way to win today against an opponent who played brilliantly... he had a lot of courage today,"" added Djokovic in Italian. ""If I want to keep up with these youngsters I'm going to have to work even harder!"" Sinner off the mark Home hope Jannik Sinner got off to a near-perfect start by beating Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4, delighting the crowd in Italy's northwest. Sinner has had the best season of his career to date, winning four tournaments and is set to become the first Italian ever to finish a season in the ATP top five. The 22-year-old comfortably dealt with 2019 champion Tsitsipas in front of an enthusiastic crowd, not dropping a service game nor facing a break point in the whole match. ""The atmosphere was really, really nice. It's huge pleasure for me to play here in Turin, in Italy,"" Sinner told reporters. ""Obviously a little bit more pressure, but I managed it really well today, so I'm happy."" Afterwards Greek Tsitsipas denied he had any physical problems even though he looked way below his best, telling reporters ""I'm healthy. I'm ready to compete."" The 25-year-old had to play down reports of an elbow injury which curtailed practice ahead of his tournament opener. ""I'm absolutely fine and I'm ready to play this tournament. Turin is one of the most important events of the year for me,"" he said. On Monday Alcaraz makes his ATP Finals debut in the Red Group against Alexander Zverev, the second seed Djokovic's closest challenger. However the Wimbledon champion is in uncertain form after being dumped out of the Paris Masters by Russian qualifier Roman Safiullin following return from an injury lay-off. The Spaniard hadn't played since the Shanghai Masters in early October due to lower back and left foot problems. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic has no intention of slowing down after capping another incredible year with Sunday's record-breaking seventh ATP Finals victory. At 36 years old Djokovic is still tennis' number one player by some distance and he has racked up a host of new records this season, taking his Grand Slam tally to 24 and finishing top of the year-end world rankings for the eighth time. He swept past young pretenders Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner on his way to triumph in Turin and is gunning for more glory in 2024, when Paris hosts the one major event where he has not won -- the Olympics. Asked what else he can accomplish in tennis, Djokovic joked: ""Well, you can win four Slams and Olympic gold"". ""I have always the highest ambitions and goals. That's not going to be different for the next year, that's for sure. The drive that I have is still there,"" he added. ""Motivation, especially for the biggest tournaments in sport, is still present... For me, obviously those are Grand Slams and Finals, and next year hopefully also Olympic Games."" The Olympics take place over July 26-August 11 in the French capital, starting less than a fortnight after Wimbledon and finishing shortly before the US Open. It is a major career goal sandwiched into an already long, draining season, one which will take its toll on all the top players let alone one heading towards his late 30s. ""It is definitely one of the major goals for next year, other than Grand Slams,"" said Djokovic. ""It's going to be very congested schedule with going from the slowest to the fastest surface in sport back to the slowest. Clay, grass, clay, then hard court. Obviously that's a very demanding, challenging stretch of the year."" Vanquished finalist Sinner hailed Djokovic as an ""inspiration"" during the trophy ceremony and is using the Serb as a model for his own bid for the sport's top honours. Both Djokovic and his coach Goran Ivanisevic predicted that Sinner, who claimed four tour-level titles this season, will one day win Grand Slams and top the world rankings. And his performances at the Pala Alpitour have been cause for great optimism within Italian tennis. ""He's an inspiration because he worked throughout the whole years before, when he was younger, in the right way to get to this point. That's also one of my goals,"" Sinner told reporters. ""It's not only about watching one season. You watch this season, and you say, OK, I played good. But you have to play well every season, and you have to get to a certain age, which is 35, 36, 37, whatever, and you can still feel the body in the right way."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"American teenager Coco Gauff shrugged off a 50-minute stoppage caused by climate protesters to power into the US Open final on Thursday with a straight sets defeat of Karolina Muchova. The 19-year-old from Florida advanced to her first final at Flushing Meadows after winning 6-4, 7-5 in a semi-final that took nearly three hours to complete due to disruption by protests. Gauff will face either second seed Aryna Sabalenka or compatriot Madison Keys in Saturday's final, who play later on Thursday. Gauff later revealed she was expecting protests during the tournament, but said she remained unfazed by treating the interruption like a weather delay. ""I thought it'd be in the final, I just treated it like a rain delay,"" she told ESPN. ""In DC and Cincinnati people were passing out (because of the heat)... so I treated it like that."" The American youngster will be targeting her first Grand Slam title after battling to victory on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court. Gauff, who is now the youngest American woman to reach the US Open final since her idol Serena Williams in 1999, had looked to be cruising towards victory in the first set. The teenager broke Muchova twice early on to race into a 5-1 lead. But her Czech opponent regained her composure and turned the tables as the fluency returned to her powerful groundstrokes. Muchova fought back to break, cutting Gauff's lead to 5-4 after the teenager had twice served for the set. However Muchova then faltered and Gauff broke back to clinch the first set when her rival hammered a backhand return into the net. The second set was only one game old when environmental activists disrupted play, chanting ""End fossil fuels"". One of the protesters glued themselves to the floor of the stands, forcing a 50-minute stoppage. When the players returned, a tense second set unfolded. Muchova held off a match point in the 10th game to level at 5-5 before Gauff held for a 6-5 lead. Muchova then saved four more match points on her serve before finally succumbing on the sixth match point, hammering a backhand return long to leave Gauff victorious. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic would not let Daniil Medvedev spoil his date with history a second time battling past the Russian 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 to win the US Open on Sunday and equal Margaret Court's record haul of 24 Grand Slams. The victory, his fourth in 10 Flushing Meadows finals, capped another remarkable Grand Slam campaign for Djokovic with wins at the Australian, French and U.S. Opens and a return to the top of the world rankings when they are updated on Monday. The 36-year-old Serb becomes the oldest U.S. Open men's winner in the Open Era and the first to win three Grand Slam events in a season for the fourth time. ""It obviously means the world to me,"" said Djokovic about his 24th Slam. ""I'm really living my childhood dream. ""To make the history of this sport is something truly remarkable, it's hard to describe the words. ""I had the childhood dream when I was 7, 8, I wanted to become the best player in the world."" And it is a dream that continues to come true. Djokovic has already won more Grand Slams than any man and now shares the overall record with Court. After clinching his historic title Djokovic threw his racquet in the air and dropped to his knees as the capacity crowd roared. He would pick himself up and find his young daughter courtside for an emotional hug before going back to the bench where he pulled out a T-shirt with ""Mamba Forever"" on the front and the number 24 on the back. The shirt was a tribute to both his achievement and late friend Los Angeles Lakers great Kobe Bryant, who wore the number throughout much of his all-star career before dying in a helicopter crash. ""I thought of doing this T-shirt, eventually, if I get the chance to win the tournament,"" said Djokovic. ""Kobe was a close friend, we chatted a lot about the winner's mentality. ""When I was struggling with injury he was one of the people I relied on the most. He was always there for any kind of counsel, advice. ""I thought 24 is the jersey that he wore when he became a legend of Lakers and world basketball."" While Djokovic and Medvedev are intriguing figures, neither has been fully embraced by the New York crowds. Until the end there was little of the electricity that crackled through Arthur Ashe during the women's final on Saturday, with no clear support for either player from an attentive but subdued audience. As the match started Djokovic walked out on to court and stared across the net at Medvedev the man once again standing between him and history just as he had two years ago. The last time the two clashed at the U.S. Open was in the 2021 final, when the Russian captured his only major and denied the Serb a rare calendar Grand Slam. While Djokovic did not speak of revenge on the road to the final the Serb is known to hold a grudge and only referenced that loss as a learning experience. Lesson learned. As expected in a contest featuring the sport's two premier hardcourt players, almost every point was contested with long rallies as both men pounded away at each other from the baseline. Djokovic came out playing with purpose and applied pressure right away breaking the third seed at the first opportunity on way to a 3-0 lead. That would be the only break Djokovic would need against a surprisingly flat Medvedev who could not manufacture a single break chance in the first set. During a marathon one hour and 44 minute, lung-bursting second set Medvedev would find life forcing a tiring Djokovic into long grinding point, after grinding point. But the tireless Russian's hard work would pay no dividends unable to convert any of his few break chances including one at 6-5 that would have given him the set. Medvedev charged in front 3-1 of the tie-break but again could not land the knockout blow as Djokovic came off the ropes to take it 7-5 and a 2-0 lead. If there is one thing Djokovic possesses it is a killer instinct and the Serb wasted no time striking breaking Medvedev to go up 3-1 in the third. A defiant Medvedev answered with his first and only break of the match but it was not enough with Djokovic hitting right back with another break then holding serve the rest of way to clinch the title. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Indian rookies Rinku Singh and Nitish Rana joined forces for a thrilling fourth wicket partnership of 66 to return Kolkata Knight Riders to winning ways against against Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League Monday. With Kolkate facing a sixth consecutive defeat, the pair came together in the 13th over and passed Rajasthan's total of 152-5 with five balls to spare to secure a seven-wicket win. Rinku hammered 42 off 23 balls with six fours and a six while Rana clubbed three boundaries and two sixes in his slightly more measured 48 off 37 balls. Rajasthan, who were put into bat, got off to a slow start with tight initial spells by the Kolkata bowlers. Indian pacer Umesh Yadav removed Rajasthan opener Devdutt Padikkal (2) early and finished his four overs with 1-24. Padikkal's partner Jos Buttler fell to New Zealand's Tim Southee for a scratchy 22. The wayward Southee went for 46 from his four overs although he also picked up the wicket of Riyan Parag for 19. Rajasthan captain Sanju Samson steadied the innings but strugled to accelerate, falling to Shivam Mavi for 54 from 49 balls, which included seven fours and a six. West Indian Shimron Hetmyer thrashed two sixes in an unbeaten 27 from 13 balls to add a gloss to the Rajasthan innings. Both Kolkata openers -- Baba Indrajith (15) and Aaron Finch (4) -- fell early and Rajasthan looked on top before their middle-order set up a successful chase. Skipper Shreyas Iyer made 34 before falling to New Zealand's Trent Boult, who gave away 25 runs in his four overs. All of the Kolkata wickets fell to Rajasthan pacers as their two main spinners -- Ravichandran Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal -- went wicketless. Rinku and Nitish, however, played flawlessly and sealed the win in the final over. Man-of-the-match Rinku said ""there is pressure in the IPL that is not there much in first-class"". ""It's been five years. I haven't been getting chances regularly. Feels good to contribute now,"" the 24-year-old added. Kolkata coach Brendon McCullum said it was ""no easy feat"" to win after five consecutive losses. ""I know it's the first year for all the guys in this team but the guys have stuck really close and we could have easily been on the other side of two or three of those games,"" he added. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh batter Liton Das has to wait to make his first appearance in the Premier League (IPL) debut as Kolkata Knight Riders opted to field an unchanged playing eleven against the Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Eden Gardens tonight. The stylish right-hander had to miss Kolkata's previous three outings in the ongoing IPL season due to his involvement with the national team. Kolkata roped in Liton for INR 50 lakh alongside star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan who, however, will miss the IPL season due to 'family emergency'. Before leaving for India after Bangladesh played their one-off Test against Ireland at home, Liton had said: ""I don't know whether I'd play or not. It's a learning process.

"Opener Liton Das joined the team in Pune today after his second visit to Bangladesh during the ongoing ICC ODI World Cup ahead of the Tigers last game in the tournament against Australia on Saturday. The 29-year-old boarded a flight in Dhaka at 2:20 pm and joined the team in Pune in the afternoon. Liton, however, missed the Bangladesh team's first training session ahead of the game against Australia. ""Liton will join the team today. He boarded a flight in Dhaka at 2:20 pm. He will attend our next training session tomorrow,"" said Bangladesh team director Khaled Mahmud to the media on Thursday. The opener and his wife are expecting the birth of their first child. He returned to Dhaka right after the game against Sri Lanka on November 6, alongside the Tigers' injured skipper Shakib Al Hasan in the same flight. Before that, Liton returned to Bangladesh on November 1, citing a family emergency. The opener then flew back to India on November 3 and reunited with the side in Delhi before the Sri Lanka game. According to sources, there were some dissatisfactions among the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials along with the Tigers team management over Liton returning to Bangladesh twice during the World Cup. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Netherlands are far from intimidated by the prospect of finishing their ICC World Cup campaign on Sunday with a game against India, the tournament's only unbeaten team, all-rounder Teja Nidamanuru said. The Dutch side, who came through the qualifiers, upset South Africa and beat Bangladesh to register two wins from their eight matches so far. ""I think to play arguably the best team in the competition at the top of the table is something that we're very excited by and it's another opportunity for us,"" Nidamanuru said after Wednesday's loss to England. ""Every time we step on the park, we're trying to showcase our skills and do the best that we can, especially being at the World Cup and coming through the journey that we've done."" This is the first time the Dutch managed two wins at a World Cup but Nidamanuru felt their performances have been inconsistent. ""We haven't put together the ideal game yet, if I'm really honest."" A middle order batter who bowls off spin, Nidamanuru said limited resources back home made it difficult to compete at the top level. ""And then you're thrust onto the ICC World Cup scene, or the qualifiers, and then you're facing quality bowlers who are bowling 135-plus kmph or turn the ball and bowl it long and effectively,"" he said. Despite the gulf in resources at the World Cup, Nidamanuru said the Dutch could improve significantly with more exposure against top teams and cited the example of Afghanistan, who managed just one win at the last two World Cups but stunned three former champions in the current edition. ""We see this as a learning block, but we're out there to compete,"" he said.

"Yashasvi Jaiswal on Thursday hit the fastest 50 in Indian Premier League history, smashing his half-century in just 13 balls for Rajasthan Royals, including 26 runs in his first over. Jaiswal hit six fours and three sixes on his way to his 50, including two maximums in the first two balls of the innings against Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens. His astonishing innings was also the second fastest in T20 history after India's Yuvraj Singh clubbed a half century off only 12 balls against England at the 2007 World Cup in South Africa. Jaiswal, 21, moved to Mumbai as a child to pursue his cricketing dream, sleeping in a tent near the Azad Maidan sports ground and fetching balls in club games to help finance his career. He won a place in the Mumbai state team in 2019 and became the youngest batsman, at 17 years and 292 days, to score a domestic one-day double century. The left-hander's big break came when he was snapped up by Rajasthan Royals for $338,000 in the 2019 auction of the world's richest T20 tournament. The previous quickest 50 in the IPL, scored in 14 balls, was by KL Rahul in 2018 for Kings XI Punjab, a feat matched by Pat Cummins in 2022 playing for Mumbai Indians. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Blazing half-centuries from England's Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal helped Rajasthan Royals climb to the top of the IPL table with a 57-run hammering of Delhi Capitals on Saturday. Last year's runners-up Rajasthan posted 199 for four after an attacking 98-run opening stand between the left-handed Jaiswal (60) and Buttler (79) in their second home at Guwahati. New Zealand's left-arm quick Trent Boult led the bowling charge with a double-wicket maiden over to restrict Delhi to 142 for nine as Rajasthan bounced back from their previous loss. Boult and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal took three wickets each. Rajasthan, who won the first edition of the Indian Premier League in 2008 under late Australian great Shane Warne, have won two of their three matches to lead the 10-team T20 tournament. David Warner's Delhi, who sidelined Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for the third time in succession, slumped to their third loss of the season in as many matches. The left-hander made 65 and got past 6,000 IPL runs but his valiant knock got little support from the other end. Delhi's Rovman Powell fell for two after he made the XI in place of Australian import Mitchell Marsh, who flew back home for his wedding and will return in a week. Jaiswal, 21, provided Rajasthan with an explosive start after being invited to bat first, the rising Indian opener smashing five boundaries in the opening over. Buttler, who batted with stitches on his finger after getting hurt while fielding in the previous match, soon took over as he hit Anrich Nortje for three straight fours in the next over. Rajasthan lost their way in the middle but Buttler, who reached his second 50 of the season with a six, soon changed gears with Shimron Hetmyer (39 not out). Buttler, who got the orange cap for leading the season's batting chart, was later substituted by spinner Murugan Ashwin under the new impact player rule. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"As fireworks lit up the Ahmedabad night sky and confetti rained on Hardik Pandya and his triumphant Gujarat Titans team mates, another edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) came to a glitzy end on Sunday after two months of breakneck action. More than 100,000 fans thronged the Narendra Modi Stadium where Gujarat capped a fairytale first season by outplaying 2008 champions Rajasthan Royals in a low-scoring final. ""This has been a truly memorable season with our fans back in the stadium, celebrating every moment,"" tweeted Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah. India's struggle to contain the COVID-19 pandemic had forced the organisers to hold the entire 2020 edition of the tournament in the United Arab Emirates, which also hosted the second half of last year's tournament. This year the entire league phase was restricted in the western state of Maharashtra to avoid air travel and minimise infection risks. Delhi Capitals still reported COVID-19 cases in their camp but the tournament chugged along. There were plenty of surprises this season to hook the fans. Two of the league's most successful and popular franchises with nine titles between them, Mumbai and Chennai, finished at the bottom. Instead, the expanded 10-team tournament witnessed the rise of Gujarat and Lucknow Super Giants, the latter also making the playoff in their debut season. Kolkata and Ahmedabad split the playoff matches and the massive turnout for the final is a testament to the unwavering appeal of the world's richest Twenty20 league. All of it augurs well for the BCCI, which has begun the process to sell the league's media rights for the 2023-27 cycle which, industry sources said, could fetch $6.7 billion.   আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Indian stars Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav smashed blistering half-centuries to help Mumbai Indians chase down 215 in a six-wicket IPL win over Punjab Kings on Wednesday. Kishan (75) and Suryakumar (66) put on a key third-wicket partnership of 116 before Tim David and Tilak Varma steered the team home with seven balls to spare in the second match of the day in Mohali. Varma smashed the winning six in his 10-ball 26, and David, who starred in his team's previous match, made 19 as the two combined in an unbeaten stand of 38. ""When we started T20 format, 140-150 was a winning score. But look at this one,"" Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma said. ""Plus one extra batter makes a huge difference as well. Not just to us but across the IPL. I just checked that the average score this IPL is 180."" The batting effort boosted Mumbai's chances of making the play-offs and trumped an unbeaten 82 by Punjab's Liam Livingstone. Mumbai switched places with Punjab to be sixth in the 10-team table led by holders Gujarat Titans. Rohit went for a duck in the first over of Mumbai's chase and impact sub Nathan Ellis sent back fellow Australian Cameron Green for 23. The left-handed Kishan, who was named man of the match, and Suryakumar, who has recently hit form after a bad start this season, turned the match around with a flurry of fours and sixes. Suryakumar raised his second successive fifty in 23 balls with two sixes and two fours off Punjab's expensive England import Sam Curran. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Rising talent Tilak Varma has earned predictions that he is destined to play for his country after lighting up the Indian Premier League with his fearless batting. Five-time champions Mumbai Indians bought Varma for $200,000 in last year's auction and the 20-year-old has repaid their faith with some stellar performances since. An attacking left-handed batsman, Varma smashed a 17-ball 37 in a crucial stand with Australia's Cameron Green in Mumbai's win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Tuesday. The knock, laced with four sixes, came at a strike-rate of over 217 and Rohit Sharma hinted that the youngster could work his way into the India team. ""What I like about his game is his approach, he is not afraid,"" Rohit, the India and Mumbai skipper, said after his team's third successive win in the IPL. ""He is not playing the bowler, he is playing the ball, which is quite important for someone of his age coming out and playing the way he is. ""He has got a long way to go and we will see him play for some different teams."" The Indian Express newspaper called Varma, who also bowls off-spin and only made his IPL debut last year, the ""IPL's best young Indian batting talent"". The numbers back that up. Varma is seventh in the list of batsmen during the current IPL with 214 runs from five matches, just a spot below Indian superstar Virat Kohli (220 from five matches). South Africa's Faf du Plessis tops the batting charts with 259 runs. - 'Maturity and flare' - Varma started this season with an unbeaten 84 off 46 balls in Mumbai's opener, albeit in a losing cause, and hit winning knocks including a quickfire 41 against Delhi Capitals. Former player and India coach Ravi Shastri told Star Sports that ""I would be very surprised if he does not play T20 cricket for India in the next six months or eight months"". ""He has got the maturity, he has got the flare. He will make a world of difference to the Indian middle-order,"" said Shastri. Varma has not always had it easy. He began his cricketing journey in the south Indian city of Hyderabad, where his father works as an electrician and did not have enough money to fund his son's training. Varma's early career was looked after by a coach who gave the youngster equipment and lifts to play in a cricket academy, according to Indian media. Varma has now played 19 times in the IPL and also turned out for India 'A', the second tier of the national cricket team. Tom Moody, a former Australia batsman who coached Hyderabad in the IPL, called Varma ""an absolute jet"" for the way he tears into opposition attacks. ""I love watching him bat,"" Moody said on ESPNcricinfo. ""It's a bit of an understatement -- but he's got a big career ahead of him, hasn't he? Not only for Mumbai Indians, but for India."" Since its inception in 2008, the IPL has been a breeding ground for young Indian talent with many top performers including Suryakumar Yadav emerging as global stars. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India superstar Virat Kohli and Afghanistan fast bowler Naveen-ul-Haq put an ugly IPL episode behind them with a warm embrace during their World Cup clash on Wednesday. Naveen ran up to Kohli for a hand shake in the middle of India's successful chase at New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium and the two hugged and smiled. Commentator Ravi Shastri joked on air, saying, ""whatever happens, Naveen has to go back to the Virat Kohli pavilion (at the Delhi ground)."" The Delhi-born Kohli was also seen gesturing to the crowd to stop taunting Naveen, who was booed by during India's eight-wicket win. Kohli and Naveen were involved in a heated on-field exchange during a tense Indian Premier League match between Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore and Lucknow Super Giants early this year. Kohli, who has often courted controversy with his aggressive approach, had to be restrained by the opposition players and later Naveen said ""I did not start the fight"". However the 24-year-old Afghan bowler has had to deal with pro-Kohli chants wherever he has played in India. Kohli made an undefeated 55 on Wednesday while Naveen finished with figures of 0-31 off his five overs. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Shakib Al Hasan has sent words of encouragement for the Bangladesh team on the eve of their Test match against New Zealand, beginning on Tuesday in Sylhet. Regular Test captain Shakib is currently rehabilitating from a finger injury suffered during Bangladesh's World Cup game against Sri Lanka, which forced him to miss their final game against Australia. During the pre-match press conference, when asked if the team would miss the services of the experienced cricketer as the hosts begin the third cycle of the ICC World Test Championship, stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto replied, ""Yes, we will definitely miss Shakib bhai, and I think every player will miss him. ""I spoke with him last night after he called. He complimented the team, urged them to succeed, and said that 'we should try to do whatever we are good at'."" Despite going through a rehabilitation phase, the star cricketer managed to stay in the spotlight after acquiring nomination from Magura-1 to represent the ruling party, Bangladesh Awami League, in the forthcoming general elections. Meanwhile, Shanto, who has previously led Bangladesh in ODIs, including two important World Cup games in India, has stated that he is confident in taking up the leadership for the Tigers in all three forms. ""As I previously stated, I believe I have the ability to lead the side in all formats.

"The Bangladesh Cricket Board's (BCB) media committee chairman Tanvir Islam Tito yesterday seemed to have fortified the board's apparent confusion in identifying elements causing the national team's World Cup fiasco with a baffling statement pointing at the media. Tito's assertions said that the media should also shoulder blame for the ruckus that Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and former captain Tamim Iqbal created through interviews that stormed Bangladesh's build-up to the World Cup. ""The media also have to take responsibility for their role in this. I always believe that we and the media are on the same side. Just as we are responsible for working to develop cricket, you also have a responsibility to provide support,"" Tito told the reporters at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium yesterday. ""We are all here because of cricket. If cricket doesn't survive, we also wouldn't be here. So that's why, maybe it would've been better if such questions were not brought up at the time,"" he added. As a plan of action in an effort to paper the cracks after the catastrophic campaign, BCB's disciplinary committee has been assigned to submit a report, supposed to determine the plan of action, if any, against Shakib and Tamim's interviews. BCB has always highlighted that centrally contracted players must abide by the board's code of conduct manual which has guidelines on how players will interact with the media. When asked if Shakib and Tamim had given such interviews in line with the code of conduct, Tito alleged that perhaps the interviews left adverse effects on the team. He also struggled to ascertain the deadline for the disciplinary committee to submit their report. ""Shakib, Tamim, Mushfiqur [Rahim], [Mahmudullah] Riyad are all senior cricketers. They are well aware of their contracts. If they [Shakib and Tamim] hadn't given such interviews right before the World Cup, we wouldn't have been in such an awkward position. It probably would've been better for the team,"" he said. There have been calls for an autopsy of Bangladesh's World Cup debacle. The calm following the team's arrival, however, reflects the board's lack of urgency and perhaps unwillingness to actively pursue the identification of the potential reasons for the failure and then a plan for a course of action going forward. Moreover, BCB's response has been nothing but ordinary despite such an appalling campaign. The board just decided to stick to the norm of getting reports from head coach Chandika Hathurusingha and team director Khaled Mahmud Sujon -- both of whom are parties in the disastrous tournament. How much those reports would help in unearthing the real causes behind the failure remains a question, especially considering team director Mahmud had talked about his lack of involvement in the team's managerial decisions in India. Expecting the BCB to act like a professional entity might be a bit stretching as it only recently learned that its women cricketers had not been receiving payments for five months due to a 'technical reason' ""Since everyone was busy playing in series, tournaments, and camps, no one felt the financial difficulty nor did anyone inform me about it. I got to know four to five days back,"" was all that chairman of BCB Women's Wing Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel had to say in his defense. Events such as these manage to puncture through BCB's boastful show of its bureaucracies. Time and time again, its lack of administrative structure has been laid bare, and usually, the explanations given rarely cease to baffle. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"From aspirations of making it to their maiden semifinal to barely qualifying for the 2025 Champions Trophy with an eighth-placed finish, Bangladesh's World Cup dream has fluctuated as wildly as its tumultuous state of affairs. If looked closely, at the core of the fiasco, two entities could be found -- skipper Shakib Al Hasan and his enabler, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). At 36, Shakib just wanted to play in what he said was going to be his World Cup swansong. He had clearly mentioned in a much-talked-about interview that he had no intention of leading the Tigers in the mega event and was only made to do so at the behest of the BCB. So, questions could be raised as to why BCB -- a board that always claims to prioritise long-term planning over anything else -- would send a team to the World Cup under someone who was reluctant to lead in the first place? Is it because there were no other suitable candidates to take the helm? If so, then that contradicts the long-stated claims of a rich pipeline and the depth of the national team's pool of players. While that is a part played by the country's cricketing governing body in the Tigers' recent slump, Shakib and the team management including head coach Chandika Hathurusingha only furthered the downward spiral. Hathurusingha could be inquired about how the bunch of players that had seen Bangladesh do decently in ODIs just months ago had lost their mojo and balance in the most crucial time while Shakib would have to justify his off-field antics more than his underwhelming on-field performances. Despite being forcibly burdened with the captaincy, expectations on Shakib were still very high, especially after his superhuman effort in the same tournament four years ago. Dealing with such pressure and cancelling out the outside noise has never been an issue for a champion cricketer like Shakib. In fact, followers of Bangladesh cricket know how he had made a pattern of covering up his off-field misdoings with immediate brilliance with the willow and the ball. But this time, things proved to be different. After being part of the chaotic process of team selection for the World Cup that saw Tamim Iqbal being left out at the last minute, Shakib only managed to drum up more controversy and almost no superhuman act on the field to cover it up. Shakib's trip to Dhaka for a few solo practice sessions with his mentor midway through the World Cup was followed by the Tigers hitting the nadir of their already abysmal campaign -- an 87-run thumping at the hands of associate member, the Netherlands, in a game where Shakib made five with the bat and scalped just a solitary wicket. Also, for the first time in a long while, Shakib even looked to have let the pressure get to him when he struggled for eight deliveries before finally opening his account in the game against Pakistan. Shakib's World Cup campaign ended with a player-of-the-match performance against Sri Lanka, but his overall 2023 World Cup figures of 186 runs at 26.57 average and nine wickets may be an outcome befitting the visible shift of focus Shakib's career has seen in the last few years. Since coming out of his ICC-sanctioned ban for failing to report corrupt approaches in 2020, Shakib has anything but stayed away from controversies. From having affiliations with betting sites, kicking stumps, arguing with on-field umpires, returning to the country for personal reasons in the middle of the Asia Cup 2023 in Sri Lanka to inaugurating jewellery shop of a fugitive criminal -- Shakib could not have made it more apparent about his priorities and reluctance to fall into line. Maybe Shakib had things clear in his mind long before his reflection on the matter came to the fore when he said in that interview, ""Would that [captaining Bangladesh in this World Cup] add any value to my career at this stage?"" Perhaps Shakib knew all along what he was taking the team into and only tried to deflect the blame in case things went south when he admitted to not being willing to be in the leadership role ahead of the World Cup. Shakib is used to evading the true repercussions of his antics, mostly by riding on the BCB's reluctance to do anything about those. It might not be any different for Shakib this time too but the same can not be said of Bangladesh cricket which will have to suffer the real consequences of always accommodating a reluctant performer. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It's almost two decades since a teenage Piyush Chawla bowled the mighty Sachin Tendulkar, his last game for India was in 2012 and at 34 he is no longer the lithe young spinner of yesteryear. But the wily leggie is having a ball with five-time champions Mumbai in the Indian Premier League, where spinners with experience are worth their weight in gold. Chawla is fourth in this IPL on the wickets table with 17 scalps to his name. It is a remarkable reversal of fortunes for the player fondly known as ""PC"", who went unsold in the 2022 IPL auction so did not play. Mumbai Indians signed the wrist-spinner at his base price of $61,000 for the current campaign -- and he has repaid that faith in spades. ""Last year when I wasn't around in IPL, a lot of people probably didn't think PC could come back,"" Chawla told AFP in an interview. ""But I was prepared mentally that I had to come back."" Chawla is third in the all-time IPL bowlers list with 174 wickets, behind Lasith Malinga (now retired) and Yuzvendra Chahal, both with 183. ""Right from the beginning my thought process is to go for wickets because in T20 batters are trying to get more runs,"" Chawla said. ""The best way to choke the run-rate is to get wickets."" Googly to god Chawla has fond memories of cleaning up Tendulkar -- India's cricketing deity -- with a googly in 2005, a match in which the then-16-year-old also outfoxed MS Dhoni for good measure. A year later Chawla was picked for the national side against England, becoming India's second-youngest Test debutant after Tendulkar and removing opposition captain Andrew Flintoff. At Mumbai, where Tendulkar is the team ""mentor"", Chawla keeps himself sharp bowling at the best of T20 talent including teammates Suryakumar Yadav, Tim David and Cameron Green. ""When I go in the nets and bowl against them and the kind of red-hot form Surya is in, if I can stop him in the nets from hitting, it means I am ready for the team,"" said Chawla. ""The way Surya manipulates the field, he is in a different zone altogether. Tim David is a dangerous customer when he comes lower down the order,"" he said. ""When I bowl to him, I make sure I am working out that in some of the game if I get a player like him, I am ready."" 'Everybody is different' Chawla was part of India's two World Cup victories, in 2007 and 2011, but his stop-start international career saw him play only three Tests, 25 ODIs and seven T20 matches. He had stints at Sussex and Somerset in England, and has been a journeyman in the IPL, playing previously for Punjab, Kolkata and Chennai. But his late-career form has seen chatter about an unlikely return to the Indian team. ""To be honest, I am not thinking too far ahead for anything,"" he said. ""I am just enjoying my cricket at the moment and I take it step by step."" Chawla, who is five foot five (1.7 metres), clearly isn't in the gym as much as super-fit Virat Kohli, who is the same age. But Chawla isn't bothered about how he looks from the outside. ""To be honest if you talk about fitness, it's not just that looking slim is fit,"" he said. ""I have been playing for almost 19-20 years... so I must have done something right regarding my fitness. ""Everybody is different, everybody's structure is different.

"Revenge will fuel Gujarat Titans' title defence when they clash with four-time winners Chennai Super Kings in Sunday's Indian Premier League (IPL) final in Ahmedabad. Gujarat, who won the title in their debut season last year, topped the group stage this season but went down to Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Chennai in the first qualifier on Tuesday. Hardik Pandya's men bounced back from that defeat to thrash the league's most successful team, Mumbai Indians, in Friday's second qualifier to set up a rematch with Chennai at Gujarat's home ground in Ahmedabad. Gujarat also have the personnel to become the first IPL franchise to win the league in their first two attempts, denying Chennai a record-equalling fifth. Opener Shubman Gill, the season's leading scorer, is in sublime form having smashed three hundreds in his last four innings. ""He is a superstar and is going to do big things to franchise cricket and Indian cricket,"" Pandya said of his India team mate Gill. The top three bowlers this season -- Mohammed Shami, Rashid Khan and Mohit Sharma -- are also from Gujarat. While seamer Shami has been particularly impressive in the powerplay overs, Rashid has spearheaded Gujarat's spin attack claiming crucial wickets at important junctures. ""When things are not going the way I like, he is someone who comes and changes momentum and makes sure we keep getting wickets,"" Pandya said of the Afghan spinner. ""We have spoken enough about Rashid but sometimes I am short of words for what he does."" Chennai will have an opportunity to match Mumbai's five IPL titles in what could be their talismanic leader Dhoni's final season. Like in his time as India captain, Dhoni has brought out the best in his team mates with his inspiring leadership. While Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad have been their leading scorers, Shivam Dube has transformed into Chennai's six-hitting machine. In the bowling department, Matheesha Pathirana and Tushar Deshpande have emerged as death-overs specialists. ""You use them in a manner where they have most chances of performing and, at the same time, groom them in the areas where they're not very strong,"" Dhoni said of his leadership approach. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India opener Shubman Gill hit his maiden IPL century to help holders Gujarat Titans secure their play-off berth with a thumping 34-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday. Gill, who smashed 101 off 58 balls, put on a 147-run stand with Sai Sudarshan, who made 47, to guide table-toppers Gujarat to 188-9 in Ahmedabad. Mohammed Shami and Mohit Sharma both took four wickets to limit Hyderabad to 154-9 as Gujarat became the first team to secure one of the four play-off spots. Gujarat, who had a fairytale debut season when they won the title last year, are also assured of a top-two finish in the group phase. Hyderabad, the 2016 champions, fell out of the play-off race, making it seven teams fighting for three remaining play-off places. Gujarat lost Wriddhiman Saha, for a duck, on the third ball of the match but Gill hit Fazalhaq Farooqi for four straight boundaries to set the pace. Gill, who jumped to second in the batting charts with 576 runs behind Bangalore skipper Faf du Plessis (631), smashed 13 fours and a six and Sudarshan was also punishing in his 36-ball stay. Hyderabad hit back with wickets and despite Gill's century in 56 balls, Gujarat managed just 34 runs in the last five overs and lost seven wickets. Bowlers did well to check Gujarat's total, which looked like going over 200, as seam bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar returned figures of 5-30 but the efforts were vain. Hyderabad were never in the chase after they fell to 12-3 with Shami taking two and further slipped to 59-7. South Africa's Heinrich Klaasen then smashed 64 and put on 68 runs with Kumar, who made 27, but the stand only reduced their margin of defeat. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Red-hot Shubman Gill smashed his third century of the IPL season to help defending champions Gujarat Titans hammer Mumbai Indians by 62 runs on Friday and set up a final against Chennai Super Kings. Gill's 126 off 60 balls powered Gujarat to 233-3, a total they defended by bowling out five-time winners Mumbai for 171 in 18.2 overs in the final playoff which started late due to rain in Ahmedabad. Gill hit 10 sixes in his knock and put on a second-wicket stand of 138 with Sai Sudharsan, who made 43, to tear into the opposition attack at the world's biggest cricket stadium. He became the leading batsman this season with 851 runs, surpassing Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Faf du Plessis (730), before he reached his IPL best and the top score of this season. Fast bowler Mohit Sharma took five wickets for Gujarat, who won last year's crown in a fairytale debut season, after a valiant 61 by Suryakumar Yadav. The 132,000-capacity stadium had over 75,000 fans in attendance to witness the home team triumph. The final will played on Sunday at the same venue after M.S. Dhoni's Chennai beat Gujarat in the first playoff earlier this week. Opener Gill, who is tipped as the future of Indian batting, made the most of a reprieve on 30 when Tim David dropped him off England fast bowler Chris Jordan. The 23-year-old Gill brought up his fifty in 32 balls and then exploded to smash sixes and reach his hundred in 49 balls, taking a bow amid a standing ovation. He finally fell to Akash Madhwal and Sudharsan retired out before skipper Hardik Pandya, who made an unbeaten 13-ball 28, and Rashid Khan finished the innings on a high with 19 runs in the final over. Mumbai's worries increased when wicketkeeper Ishan Kishan was injured after he was caught by the elbow of team-mate Jordan. He was later replaced by concussion substitute Vishnu Vinod. Tilak Varma struck 43 off 14 balls as he smashed Mohammed Shami for four fours and a six in an over but was soon bowled by Rashid's leg spin. Suryakumar attempted to mount the chase in his 38-ball knock and put on a key 51-run stand with Cameron Green, who hit 30 in a stop-start innings after being hit on the elbow by Pandya. Suryakumar made his fifty in 33 balls but was bowled Mohit, who struck twice in one over to derail the innings. Rashid trapped David lbw for two and hopes ended for Mumbai, who last won the crown in 2020. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Marcus Stoinis' unbeaten 89 and last over heroics by Mohsin Khan helped Lucknow Super Giants bolster their play-off hopes with a five-run win over Mumbai Indians in IPL on Tuesday. Mohsin, an up and coming left-arm quick who returned figures of 1-26, defended 11 off the final over as Mumbai fell short of their 178-run victory target in Lucknow. Tim David gave Lucknow a scare with his unbeaten 19-ball 32 but he and fellow Australian Cameron Green could do little against Mohsin's yorkers and discipline at the death. Impact player Yash Thakur and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi took two wickets each to add to Lucknow's bowling attack. Lucknow swapped places with five-time winners Mumbai to jump to third in their bid for a top-four finish in the group stage for a play-off berth. ""We just lost the game. We didn't play well enough to win,"" said Mumbai skipper Rohit Sharma. ""There were moments we didn't win. Unfortunate but we need to keep our heads high."" Holders Gujarat Titans have already booked their spot and assured a top-two finish. Seven off the 10 teams are fighting for the three remaining play-off places. Stoinis set up victory for Lucknow after he put on key partnerships including an 89-run stand with skipper Krunal Pandya, who retired hurt on 49, to guide Lucknow to 177-3. The Australian all-rounder walked in at 35-3 and rebuild the Lucknow innings with the left-handed Pandya on a not-so-easy pitch to bat. Pandya was cramping in his knock and retired one short of fifty but Stoinis soon changed gears as he raised his fifty with a six and lay into Chris Jordan in a 24-run 18th over. He put on an unbeaten 60-run stand off 24 balls with Nicholas Pooran, who made eight, and finished the innings with a six. ""We have shown that we are a real team, there no super stars, there are different people performing for us,"" said man of the match Stoinis. In reply, Ishan Kishan smashed 59 and put on a 90-run opening stand with Rohit, who made 37. Bishnoi sent the two back in the pavilion and Thakur got the big wicket of Suryakumar Yadav, for seven.

"Marcus Stoinis scored his maiden one-day century but it was not enough to give an undermanned Australia an astonishing victory in the opening match of their one-day series against New Zealand at Eden Park on Monday. Stoinis, who also took three wickets in New Zealand's 286 for nine from 50 overs, guided Australia from 54-5 in the 13th over to within sight of victory as he grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck. The 27-year-old, playing his second one-day international, shared in an 81-run seventh-wicket partnership with James Faulkner (25) and 48 with Pat Cummins (36) for the eighth before Stoinis exploded for 31 runs in 11 balls to put his side into a position where they needed 19 runs from the final 24 balls. Such was his dominance he and last man Josh Hazlewood shared a 54-run partnership, without the tall fast bowler facing a single delivery. Hazlewood, however, was run out while backing up too far by New Zealand captain Kane Williamson on the final ball of the 47th over to dismiss the visitors for 280, giving New Zealand a six-run victory. Stoinis was left stranded on 146 not out, having hit nine boundaries and 11 sixes. Australia were already missing David Warner (rested), Usman Khawaja (in Dubai preparing for the tour of India) and Steve Smith (injured) but then lost stand-in captain Matthew Wade before play began with a back injury. New Zealand had been well in control of the match as make-shift wicketkeeper Tom Latham repaid the faith of the selectors with three catches and two stumpings. Latham, who was a wicketkeeper earlier in his career, took the gloves ahead of the uncapped Tom Blundell as the selectors looked to build more flexibility in their squad ahead of the Champions Trophy in England later this year. The hosts had been humbled in a 3-0 series loss in Australia before Christmas but showed a marked improvement in their fielding and bowling as they put the visitors under pressure from the start of their run chase. New Zealand's innings was anchored by Neil Broom's 73, while Martin Guptill added 61 at the top of the order. The three-match series continues with further matches in Napier on Feb. 2 and Hamilton on Feb. 5.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Eoin Morgan has called for cricket's Decision Review System (DRS) to be used in Twenty20 internationals after a final over umpiring error cost England victory in the second match of their series against India. Needing just eight to win off the final over in Nagpur on Sunday night, England were stunned by the dismissal of their star batsman Joe Root off the first ball and ultimately fell five runs short of their target. TV replays showed that Root had got a thick inside edge onto his pads but he had no chance of challenging Indian umpire Chettithody Shamshuddin's decision as DRS is only used in Test match and ODI cricket. The same umpire also turned down a vehement lbw appeal from England bowler Chris Jordan who was convinced he had dismissed Virat Kohli during India's innings. Replays indicated that the ball would have hit off and middle stumps but Kohli, who was on seven at the time, was reprieved and went on to score another crucial 14 runs. England skipper Morgan admitted there was ""extreme frustration"" in the visitors' dressing-room after the match, saying it was time for DRS to be introduced for the game's shortest format. ""The fact it's not (available) is a concern. There is as much on the line as there is in a Test or a one-day match so no reason why it shouldn't be used,"" Morgan told the post-match press conference. ""If this was a World Cup game tonight and we were out of the World Cup or lost a World Cup final we'd be spewing."" Asked whether England would raise Shamshuddin's performance with the match referee Andy Pycroft of Zimbabwe, Morgan said ""absolutely"". ""We have an opportunity to do that before the next game, there's always feedback given through the match referee on our report,"" he said. ""It's part and parcel of the job to be able to cope with the pressure and make good decisions more often than not,"" Morgan added. While DRS has been employed in Test matches since 2009 and was introduced in ODIs in 2011, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has refused to sanction its use in T20s on the grounds that it would slow down the game. While England have been strong advocates of DRS, India has been much more reluctant to embrace the system. Last year's Test series against England was the first time that India had agreed to its use in five-day cricket. India's victory in Nagpur enabled them to level the three-match series ahead of the decider on Wednesday night in Bangalore. While Root's dismissal was a severe blow to England's chances, they were also undone by outstanding bowling from Jasprit Bumrah at the death as they tried to chase down a relatively modest target of 145. After dismissing Root for 38, he also took the wicket of the big-hitting Jos Buttler and conceded just two runs in the final over as the hosts grabbed an unlikely win. Indian veteran Ashish Nehra said his 23-year-old bowling partner had displayed nerves of steel to keep his line right at the death. ""Hats off to him, this isn't the first time he's done it for India,"" Nehra told reporters. ""Jasprit asked me if he should bowl length. All I told him was 'you have a good yorker, look to bowl full, it's tough to hit a six even if it is a low full toss.' It worked."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Fast bowler Ashish Nehra claimed three wickets as he combined with Jasprit Bumrah to choke the England batting and set up India's series levelling five-run win in the second T20I in Nagpur on Sunday. Chasing 145 for victory, England needed eight off the final over but Bumrah claimed two wickets and gave away just two runs to help the hosts even out the three-match series at 1-1. Joe Root, hit a run-a-ball 38, was given out lbw off Bumrah on the first ball of the 20th over as replays suggested the batsman got an inside edge before the ball hit his pads. Bumrah bowled Jos Buttler on the fourth delivery and never allowed Chris Jordan and Moeen Ali to score the remaining runs on the final two balls as England ended on 139 for 6. Earlier Lokesh Rahul hit a 47-ball 71 to help India post 144-8 despite England seamer Chris Jordan's three wickets after the visitors elected to field first.

"When Shakib Al Hasan came to the crease yesterday in the fourth over, the top-order was once again struggling; this time at 15 for two. Shakib may not have found the hundred he would have been desperate to get, but during a crucial 101-run stand with Tawhid Hridoy, he batted to a plan to bring much-needed respite for Bangladesh in their Asia Cup Super Four fixture against India in Colombo. After missing out on a single, the stump mic caught him telling Hridoy, ""You know how much further we have to go?"" It was a reminder of the task ahead. And as the only veteran in the playing eleven, it was much needed. Judging from his remarks before the game, he was acutely asking his players to take up their end of the bargain. He demonstrated how he does his bit. ""Here experience or inexperience or new and old doesn't come into the equation,"" he had said. It was the scenario the Tigers' veterans and youngsters have to play if the team are to find rhythm at the upcoming World Cup. With Anamul Haque Bijoy once again failing to impress and Mehedi Miraz departing soon after, the Tigers' batting recovery hinged on Shakib and Hridoy's partnership. Shakib, was comfortable in shot-making from the onset but impatience was showing as well. He had to gradually settle down with wickets falling around him. It had been 36 innings since his last ODI ton; in fact, he has not reached three figures in any format since his blistering 124 not out against the Windies at the 2019 World Cup. But as he has shown many times, he often does not worry about the numbers as long as he is contributing. He has scored fifty 11 times, crossing 90 twice since that ton against Windies. The unbeaten 96 against Zimbabwe was the closest he got to a hundred since then. When he came on, it felt like he needed some luck on his side to play a bigger innings. He had got going against Pakistan in this Asia Cup too, but did not make enough to really make an impact. This time against India, despite it being a dead rubber, Shakib needed some confidence to carry to the World Cup. It is after all, his individual responsibility to shine with the bat at the World Cup. That rub of the green came in the 19th over, when off-spinner Tilak Varma troubled him and got the outside edge but only for KL Rahul to drop a difficult chance behind the stumps. Shakib would then get the wake-up call. With the spinners introduced, he found negotiating Varma difficult. But when India wanted to squeeze the run-rate, Shakib had finally found his preferred matchups in Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja. While risks could not assure favourable results with a lot of rebuilding to do, Shakib and Hridoy were calculative. Thus, Hridoy went after Varma, the right-arm off-spinner, hitting two sixes in the 23rd over. Shakib picked the cue for acceleration and hit Patel for two through mid-wicket. As spinners were trying to go through their overs fast, Shakib faced 20 deliveries from Patel, hitting 27 runs and picking 22 from the 17 deliveries he faced against Jadeja. Hridoy had taken Verma for 15 off the nine he faced against his favourable matchup. When it looked assured that Shakib would convert the 80 to a ton, he fell to a careless shot, at a time the team needed a bigger contribution from him. Hridoy's fifty would ensure at least 200 on the board before Nasum Ahmed and Mahedi Hasan finished well. Despite the lacklustre state of the batting department, some nuance shown by the skipper and others after yet another top-order struggle should set the Tigers on a better plan for their batting department. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan castled India's Suryakumar Yadav to reduce them to five down for 139 in the 33rd over in their Asia Cup Super Four contest at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday.

"Despite not being in the running for the final, Bangladesh ended their Asia Cup on a high by beating India in a tight Super Four game in Colombo's R Premadasa Stadium on Friday. After Shakib Al Hasan's 80 rebuilt the innings, the Tigers needed to overcome a compact Shubman Gill ton as some pride was restored. Youngster Tanzim Hasan Sakib, making his debut, got the new ball talking in a way which should keep selectors on their toes while his cool effort in the final over ensured a six-run win – Tigers' second in the Asia Cup history against India. Earlier, skipper Shakib and Tawhid Hridoy's 101-run fifth-wicket stand, turned things around after early collapse. Nasum Ahmed and Sheikh Mahedi made important contributions with the bat in the lower middle-order as the score climbed to 265. On his debut, the 20-year-old Sakib, removed Rohit Sharma in just the second delivery of the innings. Even the confident and in-form Gill had to persevere during Sakib's spell. In his next over, Sakib took the top of Tilak Varma's off-stump with one that moved in after pitching, with the batter leaving the delivery alone only to find himself castled. The youngster bowled six overs on the trot with the new ball, giving away just 15 runs. ""Rohit bhai was my dream wicket, my debut wicket. I just concentrated on line and length and maintained it and that's how I got the early success. I am always prepared for bowling longer spells when my team needs me. I am always ready to bowl,"" he said at the post-match ceremony. Despite being taken for 12 runs in the 39th over by Gill, Sakib was entrusted to bowl the last over with India requiring 12. He mixed his deliveries and then bowled a yorker in the penultimate delivery where a run-out secured the win. ""That ball, I was once again thinking of the bowlers but it was very tight with two balls and eight runs. So I went for the yorker. I believed that I would bowl the perfect yorker and that's what happened,"" Sakib added on his death over bowling performance. It was not just Sakib but also Mustafizur Rahman's death bowling that came to the Tigers' rescue. The left-arm paceman saw the back of dangerous Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel, bagging three for 50 in eight overs. Yet, with just two pacers in the armoury, the Tigers' spin attack had to do the bulk of the bowling. Shakib himself was economical and effective, also bagging Suryakumar Yadav's scalp while Mahedi and Mehedi Hasan Miraz took crucial wickets. ""After the last couple of games here, we thought spinners will do well,"" Shakib said after the match. Mahedi had given the important breakthrough earlier with KL Rahul's wicket before his death over efforts kept things tight while also removing Gill after a 133-ball 122 that really put the pressure on India. With the World Cup to come, the win should serve as a morale-boosting one. ""A lot of players are injured and some going in and out, that didn't help us. I think we will be a dangerous side in the World Cup,"" Shakib said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Bangladesh team reached Pune earlier today on a chartered flight. Shakib Al Hasan's side will take on hosts India in their fourth ICC World Cup fixture on October 19 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune. The Tigers will be sweating on Shakib's scan reports which are reportedly due today. Bangladesh succumbed to their second consecutive defeat in the World Cup when they received an eight-wicket thumping at the hands of New Zealand in Chennai on Friday. Shakib, who had to leave the ground after hurting his left quad before the Tigers' game against New Zealand ended, was taken for a scan after the match yesterday. The ace all-rounder suffered from cramps while he was batting in the first innings of the match which prompted him to throw his wicket away as he tried to hit his way out of trouble.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"There had been a lot of hype surrounding Bangladesh's pace-bowling unit ahead of the ICC World Cup, having made significant strides in the last few years. The likes of Taskin Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Shoriful Islam, and Hasan Mahmud managed to gain the confidence of the team management with their consistent ability to pose a threat to the opposing batters, prompting the team management to keep its faith in the seamers intact. Considering current year's records, the impact of Bangladeshi pacers speaks for itself, as they managed to turn the table in their favour with 94 wickets, which is 32 more than their spin unit's tally. However, Bangladesh's seamers have been underwhelming in their three World Cup games so far. Despite defeating Afghanistan in the tournament opener, skipper Shakib Al Hasan mentioned after the game that he expected the pacers to contribute more to the team's cause. From then on, the situation quickly deteriorated as the Tigers went on to lose their next two games, both in convincing ways, against England and New Zealand. Although Batting display has been the standout disappointment, Bangladesh quicks also performed below par. Shoriful, along with Shakib, has taken the most wickets for Bangladesh thus far in the tournament. The left-arm pacer took five wickets in three games, but he would like to improve his economy rate, 6.28, which remained on the higher side. Probably the biggest concern for the Tigers' pace unit would be Taskin. The tall quick, who was expected to lead the Bangladesh pace battery in the flagship event, seems to be struggling to find his rhythm. Taskin only grabbed two wickets in three games, with an economy of 6.30. Because of his inconsistency, the 28-year-old was unable to bowl his complete quota of overs in each of the three matches. Furthermore, his pace appears to have slowed so far in the World Cup. Mustafizur Rahman, another experienced bowler, must also fire on all cylinders as the 'Cutter Master' has only two wickets to his name. Despite the fact that the Indian conditions were predicted to help spinners more, pacers are among the four out of top five wicket-takers in this tournament. Allan Donald, Bangladesh's pace-bowling coach, has been instrumental in creating the new-look Bangladesh pace outfit. The South Africa great was spotted working closely with his charges during yesterday's training session at Pune's Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium ahead of their India clash on Thursday. Given the Indian batters' rich vein of form, spearheaded by captain Rohit Sharma, Bangladesh could choose to feature their fifth pace option in Tanzim Hasan Sakib after he impressed on his international debut last month. In that match, against India in the Asia Cup, the right-arm seamer removed the Indian captain in his second delivery. If Bangladesh fail to make the first Powerplay count on both batting and bowling yet again, Tigers' prospect to return to winning ways becomes much more difficult. Thus, Mustafizur and company will be desperate to produce early inroads and regain their confidence as the pressure mounts on the side. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India's crushing victory over Sri Lanka on Sunday for their eighth Asian crown with a bowling masterclass from Mohammed Siraj gives skipper Rohit Sharma confidence ahead of the World Cup. Siraj returned figures of 6-21 as India bundled out Sri Lanka for 50 in 15.2 overs and won the lop-sided final by 10 wickets in Colombo. Indian bowlers led by pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and spinner Kuldeep Yadav stood out in the 50-over tournament, which served as a tune-up for the ODI World Cup starting October 5 in India. ""It gives us a lot of confidence to come here and win a tournament like this,"" Rohit told reporters after the title win came in just 116 minutes of play. ""At various stages of the tournament we were challenged in different parts of our game and we stood up to those challenges against various conditions, various bowling types."" He said, ""We can take a lot of positives from the tournament, not just for one or two players but for the entire squad. They did their job."" Sri Lanka elected to bat first but play started after a rain delay and Siraj made most of the pitch and the overcast conditions to pick four wickets in one over. Siraj was named man of the match for his seven overs of dominant bowling while Kuldeep was the player of the series for his nine wickets in the tournament. ""When I see bowlers like this bowl like this, I get a lot of satisfaction,"" said Rohit. ""I think fast bowling is something captains take a lot of pride in. In fact, all the five bowlers have a lot of skill-set and variation. When you get all this as a captain you feel confident."" In the Super Fours, India posted 356-2 in their 228-run hammering of arch-rivals Pakistan before they defended 213 against Sri Lanka to march into the final. ""Nature of this pitch here is challenging and unexpected as well. Siraj has to be mentioned here because when the pitch is so dry, to get the ball to move around like that is a special skill set."" The batsmen shone for India after Virat Kohli and the returning KL Rahul hit centuries against Pakistan in the Super Fours and Rohit praised the all-round effort. ""Guys can stand up under pressure and perform the job for the team and same goes for the bowlers as well,"" Rohit said of his team's all-round showing. ""Our fielding was outstanding in this series. Slip catches against pacers. We will have off days on the field is fine as long as you back it up with a solid performance the next day.""

"India hammered Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the Asia Cup final on Sunday after nearly three weeks of action and rain in the regional tournament. The 50-over competition hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka was a tune-up for the upcoming ODI World Cup in India for five of the six participating teams. AFP Sport looks at five key moments. Shaheen fires Pakistan's Shaheen Shah Afridi made an early statement when he rattled India with his left-arm pace in a group match washed out due to rain. Shaheen bowled skipper Rohit Sharma and then Virat Kohli, and fellow quicks Haris Rauf and Naseem Shah combined to dismiss India for 266 in the only innings possible in Pallekele. In the next meeting between the arch-rivals, the Pakistan quicks went for runs as India posted 356-2 in their 228-run win. Naseem and Rauf suffered injuries in the game in a blow to Pakistan ahead of the World Cup, but in an interview with AFP, Shaheen said his ""best is yet to come"". Siraj blitz India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj saved the best for the last when he ripped through the Sri Lankan batting with six wickets including four in one over. Siraj returned his ODI best figures of 6-21 in a devastating spell of fast bowling in overcast conditions, to help skittle out Sri Lanka for 50 in 15.2 overs. The performance capped off a dominant few weeks for India after they crushed Pakistan by 228 runs in their Super Four match with centuries from Virat Kohli and KL Rahul. Opener Shubman Gill also made his presence felt with a sparkling 121 -- albeit in a lost cause -- in an inconsequential match against Bangladesh. Wellalage shines Dunith Wellalage was a part of Sri Lanka's young players who put up a strong show for the underdogs, after they snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. The left-arm spinner claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in a Super Four clash versus India, and got the key wickets of Rohit and Kohli to bowl the opposition out for 213. Sri Lanka fell short in their chase despite Wellalage's unbeaten 42, but the performance from the 20-year-old boosted the team's confidence. Fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and batsman Charith Asalanka then helped the island nation edge out Pakistan in a last-ball thriller to make the final. Rain warriors An army of 100 ground staff wearing orange jerseys ran with the covers every time rain halted play and were hailed as ""unsung heroes"" by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and Sri Lanka Cricket. Rain played havoc in the tournament which had nine of the 13 matches played in Sri Lanka, after India refused to tour Pakistan due to political tensions. Showers in Pallekele meant the blockbuster India-Pakistan match was abandoned, and rain followed the teams to Colombo in a Super Four game which was awarded a reserve day -- much to the annoyance of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Rohit and Kohli thanked the groundsmen for their efforts and the ACC and SLC promised a $50,000 bonus shared between the staff. Nepal debut Nepal had a baptism by fire on their Asia Cup debut when Pakistan bundled out the cricketing minnows for 104 in the opener in Multan. But the Rohit Paudel-led side made an impression against big guns India, when they posted 230 all out in 48.2 overs in a rain-hit group game they eventually lost by 10 wickets. Paudel said he and his players spoke to Rohit and Kohli after the game, a meeting that proved ""useful"" to them. Nepal, who are still finding their feet in international cricket and got ODI status in 2018, made waves after they reached the ODI World Cup qualifiers earlier this year. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"India superstar Virat Kohli bowled in a one-day international for the first time in six years after all-rounder Hardik Pandya limped off midway through an over in Thursday's World Cup match against Bangladesh. Bowling gentle medium pace, Kohli conceded just two runs, a fine return given Bangladesh's openers were starting to up the tempo after stand-in captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, leading the team in place of the injured Shakib Al Hasan, won the toss. It was the first time Kohli had bowled at this level since a 2017 return of 0-12 in two overs against Sri Lanka in Colombo -- a match where he scored 131 in a crushing 168-run win. But there was not much Kohli could do as Bangladesh advanced to 63 without loss off the opening 10 overs. Pandya had just been hit for consecutive boundaries by Liton Das when he appeared to twist his ankle just three balls into his stint as first change in the ninth over. Following prolonged on-field treatment, Pandya tried running into bowl. But clearly still in pain, he could only hobble towards the crease and eventually limped off the field, with key batsman Kohli completing the over to huge cheers as India fans savoured the rare sight of their hero bowling. Left-hander Tanzid Hasan was then 40, having hooked fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah for an impressive six and stylishly driven Mohammed Siraj down the ground for four. He then struck Shardul Thakur for 16 runs in three balls, two sixes -- one over square leg and the other lofted over extra-cover -- separated by a four driven through mid-on.

"Bangladesh beat India by six runs in their final Asia Cup Super Four contest at the R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday. The win brought the Tigers their first-ever win in Colombo but it only came as a consolation as the Shakib Al Hasan-led side had already exited the competition. The Tigers bundled out India for 259 after posting 265 for eight having being sent to bat first. India opener Shubman Gill notched up his fifth ODI ton that saw him smash five sixes and eight fours in his 133-ball 121 that almost took the game away from Bangladesh. Axar Patel's 34-ball 42 almost took India to the brink of victory late on in the game but Mustafizur Rahman outfoxed him with a trademark cutter in the 49th over to take the Tigers on the shores of victory. The Fizz picked up three wickets for 50 runs, with two of the scalps coming in the 49th over, while Sheikh Mahedi Hasan and debutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib scalped two wickets each. Earlier, fifties from Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan and batter Towhid Hridoy helped the Tigers post 265. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"David Warner is under fire in the Indian Premier League after the Australian's Delhi Capitals lost for a fourth time in as many matches and sit bottom of the pile. The opening batsman and skipper has hit three half-centuries in this year's edition of the Twenty20 tournament but his runs have come at a sluggish strike rate of 114.83. At his explosive best, the 36-year-old left-hander is a match-winner. He boasts a strike rate of 141.30 in his 99 T20 innings for Australia. But he cannot get going in this year's IPL and his snail-paced 51 runs off 47 deliveries in Tuesday's last-ball loss to the Mumbai Indians did little to quell concerns about his decline. The once-destructive Australian appears laboured, even nervous. ""Even in the last couple of games, when he has been trying to hit, it's not been coming off,"" deputy skipper Axar Patel told reporters after the agonising defeat to five-time champions Mumbai. ""As a batsman, I don't know what he is thinking at that moment."" Warner's innings got a boost in a 67-run sixth-wicket stand with Axar, who smashed a 25-ball 54, but Delhi were all out for 172 and their opponents went on to win by six wickets. Delhi are bottom of the 10 teams in the IPL and the only side yet to win a match. Axar said that Warner has spoken to Ricky Ponting and Shane Watson, two Australian greats on Delhi's coaching staff, as he bids to get firing again. He has also been counselled by former Indian Test captain Sourav Ganguly, Delhi's director of cricket. ""The conversation about his strike rate also came up. They looked at his videos and he's working on it,"" said Axar. Pundits have been scathing in their assessment of Warner's struggles. ""I feel it is time that we tell him in English now so that Warner listens to it and feels hurt,"" former India opener Virender Sehwag told Cricbuzz after the weekend's 57-run loss to Rajasthan Royals. Warner made 65 in 55 balls before Delhi went down tamely in their chase of 200 in Guwahati. ""David, if you are listening, please play well... If you cannot do that, do not come and play in the IPL,"" said Sehwag. Renowned commentator Harsha Bhogle responded to Tuesday's knock from the veteran opener by lamenting how difficult it was to watch ""the great David Warner struggle"". The Australian had been a drag on the team, Bhogle said. ""He has been very honest about it, but at the moment, it isn't helping DC get the momentum they need,"" he wrote on Twitter. Delhi, who have never won the IPL, are now in danger of an early exit from the play-off race. The franchise suffered an early blow when skipper Rishabh Pant was involved in a car crash in December and was ruled out of the season, propelling Warner into the captaincy. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A maiden IPL century by Prabhsimran Singh and four wickets for Harpreet Brar powered Punjab Kings to a 31-run win and ended Delhi Capitals' hopes of making the play-offs on Saturday. Opening batsman Prabhsimran's 103 off 65 balls guided Punjab to 167-7 after being put in to bat first at Delhi's Feroz Shah Kotla ground. Brar then returned figures of 4-30 with his left-arm spin as Delhi suffered a collapse to end on 136-8 despite a strong start from skipper David Warner, who hit 54 off 27 balls. Punjab moved to sixth to improve their chances of making the final four for a spot in the play-offs. Delhi remain bottom of the heap and are out of the running. Warner seemed to take the game away with his power hitting but Brar led the spin charge, removing Phil Salt for 21 as Delhi slipped from 69-0 to 88-6. Leg-spinner Rahul Chahar joined in to trap Mitchell Marsh lbw before Brar struck twice in an over to dismiss Rilee Rossouw and Warner, who registered his 60th IPL fifty. Impact player Nathan Ellis, who came in as a substitute for Prabhsimran, took two wickets with his pace bowling. Prabhsimran set the victory up for Punjab, smacking 10 fours and six sixes to play a lone hand in his team's total. Punjab lost three early wickets including skipper Shikhar Dhawan, for seven, and England's Liam Livingstone, for four -- both falling to senior pace bowler Ishant Sharma. Prabhsimran stood firm and put on a key partnership of 72 with Punjab's expensive England import Sam Curran, who made 20. The rest of the batting disappointed with Prabhsimran, who survived a dropped catch by Rossouw on 68, standing tall until his dismissal in the 19th over. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Mustafizur Rahman has found game time hard to come by in the ongoing Indian Premier League. The left-arm pacer, since joining his Delhi Capitals side on April 1, has only featured in two matches, remaining highly ineffective in both of those games. After sitting out Delhi's first three matches of this IPL campaign, Mustafizur started against Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore. Delhi lost both the matches and the left-arm pacer was able to scalp only a solitary wicket in the two matches while giving away a total of 79 runs bowling seven overs. In his last game for Delhi against RCB on April 15, Mustafizur went for 41 in just three overs at 13.66 economy rate and was substituted out under the new impact player rule. When asked about concerns regarding Mustafizur being out of form during a press conference in Sylhet today, Bangladesh head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said: ""Mustafizur out of form? It is difficult to say whether someone is out of form or not if that person has not played many games in recent times."" ""Mustafizur has not played many games recently. Whenever he played here [for Bangladesh], he did well and did his job for the team. So, I need to assess how he performs once he returns [from IPL],"" Hathurusingha added. Bangladesh team are currently in Sylhet in a three-day camp ahead of their tour to the United Kingdom for a three-match ODI series against Ireland, part of the ODI Super League. The Tigers will have their final practice session in Sylhet today before boarding the Dhaka-bound flight in the evening. Bangladesh are scheduled to leave for the UK on May 2.

"Indian batsman Aman Khan's defiant 51 and inspired bowling helped Delhi Capitals edge out holders Gujarat Titans by five runs in a low-scoring Indian Premier League thriller on Tuesday. Aman hit his maiden fifty to lift his team from a precarious 23-5 to 130-8 in a clash billed as David v Goliath between bottom-placed Delhi and table-toppers Gujarat in Ahmedabad. Gujarat pace spearhead Mohammed Shami's bowling figures of 4-11 -- his IPL best -- went in vain but was named man of the match. Delhi bowlers led by left-arm quick Khaleel Ahmed and Ishant Sharma limited Gujarat to 125-6 despite an unbeaten 59 by skipper Hardik Pandya and Rahul Tewatia's seven-ball 20. ""Our bowlers were absolutely amazing,"" Delhi skipper David Warner said. ""Our bowlers were amazing. Our batters struggled but credit to the way Shami bowled. We just find ways to lose wickets in clumps, I don't know what's happening with our batting."" The left-handed Tewatia, called ""iceman"" for his ability to hit sixes in pressure situations, smashed Anrich Nortje for three straight hits over the fence in the 19th over but fell in the 20th. Ishant returned figures of 2-23 and held his nerve in the final over with Gujarat needing 12 to win and falling short. Gujarat, who had a fairytale IPL debut after they won the crown last season, remain strong to make the play-offs with six wins in nine matches. Delhi, coached by Ricky Ponting, are have registered their third win in nine matches to keep their play-off hopes alive. It was Aman's 44-ball knock that made Delhi fightback as he put on key partnerships including fifty-plus stands with Axar Patel (24) and Ripal Patel (23) to give his team a total, which ultimately made them win their third match in nine outings. Aman smashed three fours and three sixes in his 44-ball knock before falling to Rashid Khan's leg spin. Shami got Phil Salt for a first ball duck and then Rilee Rossouw, for eight, in his two overs before a double strike in his third. In reply, Khaleel struck in the first over and soon Gujarat were in deep trouble when South African big-hitter David Miller fell for a duck. Pandya attempted to turn it around in a 62-run partnership with Abhinav Manohar, who made 26, but the effort was not enough as Delhi defended their lowest total ever. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Axar Patel starred with bat and bowl and impact sub Mukesh Kumar held his nerve as Delhi Capitals edged Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven runs in a low-scoring Indian Premier League battle on Monday. Meanwhile, this is the second game on the trot that Delhi left out Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman from the playing eleven after the left-arm pacer had disappointed in the previous two games. Mustafizur could scalp only a solitary wicket in the games he played against Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore in this edition of IPL. In today's game, the left-handed Axar (34) lifted Delhi from a precarious 62-5 to 144-9 in a gritty partnership of 69 with Manish Pandey (34) on Hyderabad's home turf. Axar then returned figures of 2-21 with his left-arm spin. Fast bowler Mukesh, who came in under the new impact player rule, defended 12 off the final over to keep Hyderabad down to 137-6. It was Delhi's second successive victory after starting the season with five losses. The David Warner-led team stayed bottom of the 10-team heap. ""I love it here. It's an amazing crowd. I haven't been here for a long time,"" Warner, after playing at his former franchise, which he led to victory in 2016, said. The Australian opener said, ""To win tonight, hopefully we can make it three in a row. We've got another against Sunrisers next."" Hyderabad, led by Aiden Markram, are one place above Delhi on ninth with four points and five losses. Delhi's South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje dented the Hyderabad chase as he bowled Harry Brook bowled for seven. Axar soon joined in to cut short Mayank Agarwal's knock on 49. Pace spearhead Ishant Sharma and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav picked up a wicket each to rattle the opposition middle-order before Heinrich Klaasen and Washington Sundar attempted to revive the chase. Klaasen fell to Nortje after a 19-ball 31 and Sundar, a left-hand batsman, made an unbeaten 24 but Mukesh and Delhi had the last laugh. Delhi elected to bat first but lost half their side, including Warner who hit 21, in eight overs before Axar and Pandey turned the innings around. ""I ordered for coffee and I left the glass like that, when three wickets fell in one over,"" man of the match Axar said with a smile. ""Pandey and I discussed we need to take it as deep as possible."" Sundar returned figures of 3-28 with his mystery spin as he struck three times in one over including the wicket of Warner.

"Ravindra Jadeja's 3-22 led Chennai's dominance in spin-friendly conditions at home for a smooth seven-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League Friday. The visitors managed just 134-7 after being sent in to bat and Jadeja's four-over spell for the Super Kings choked their innings before it could get going. ""It is a good track to bowl on for me,"" Jadeja said. ""The ball stops a bit here and I am able to trap the batsmen bowling straight."" Opener Abhishek Sharma was the one bright spot for Hyderabad with 34 off 26 balls before the home town's spinners applied the squeeze. Harry Brook, who scored this IPL's first century two innings ago, only managed 18 off 13 balls. Apart from Sharma, only number three batter Rahul Tripathi crossed the 20-run mark for Hyderabad. Skipper M.S. Dhoni put on a clinic behind the stumps, snapping up Aiden Markram before stumping Mayank Agarwal. Later he also ran out Washington Sundar, overcoming a troublesome knee injury. The hosts eased to 138-3 in reply with eight balls to spare as opener Devon Conway scored his third consecutive tournament half-century. Conway finished undefeated on 77 from 57 balls with 12 fours and a six although the capacity home crowd were a little disappointed at not getting to see Dhoni at the crease. Speculation is rife that this tournament will be the beloved 41-year-old's last, but Dhoni could return to his home ground next month with Chennai now third on the table. The IPL finals schedule was announced before the match with the first qualifier and eliminator to be played in the city on May 23 and 24.

"India player Ravichandran Ashwin was at the receiving end of online bashing for stating that the return of his former IPL team Chennai Super Kings will increase its value just like Manchester United when eight players of the English football club died in an air crash in Munich, 1958. ""I think the two-year hiatus for CSK probably increases its value much like what it did for Manchester United when the air crash happened. “I don't know if it's in the same league but surely people in Chennai and fans across the world are waiting for CSK to return. I hope it turns out to be a good comeback,"" Ashwin told cricbuzz. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were banned for two years after their owners were found to be involved in betting activities. The comparisons drew criticism on social media, especially from Manchester United fans. The 1958 Munich air crash crippled Manchester United, who had to play local boys in order to respect their fixtures and complete the season. Ashwin took to twitter to justify his comparison and said: “Guys please take the reporting with a pinch of salt with respect to the Munich tragedy and CSK.   আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Manchester United footballer Harry Maguire on Wednesday accepted the apology of a Ghanaian MP who mocked him during a parliamentary debate on the budget last year. Opposition lawmaker Isaac Adongo compared Vice-President Mahamadu Bawumia's economic management of the embattled West African nation to Maguire's performance on the pitch. In an address shared widely on social media last year, Adongo compared Bawumia to Maguire, who he described as ""the biggest threat at the centre of the Manchester United defence"". The reference was part of a wider speech accusing Bawumia of mismanaging the economy and inflicting hardship on citizens. Ghana is grappling with its worst economic crisis in a generation brought on by spiralling public debt, which has triggered rampant inflation and weakened the local currency. In a similar debate on the 2024 budget on Tuesday, Adongo said Maguire had ""turned the corner"" and took back his analogy. ""I now apologise to Harry Maguire,"" Adongo said. ""He is a transformational footballer... now scoring goals for Manchester United."" Maguire accepted the apology in a post on X on Wednesday. ""MP Issac Adongo apology accepted. See you at Old Trafford soon,"" he wrote, referring to the home of Manchester United. Adongo, however, did not relent his criticism of Bawumia, accusing him of ""roaming"" around the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ""with a cup in hand"". Ghana's government turned to the IMF for help last year. The Fund approved a three-year, $3 billion programme in May, with an immediate disbursement of $600 million. Bawumia heads the government's economic management team as has been selected as the ruling party candidate for 2024 elections. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Harry Maguire should leave Manchester United if he is not confident enough to fight for his place, manager Erik ten Hag said, amid reports that the defender is on the verge of completing a transfer to West Ham United. Ten Hag stripped Maguire of the captaincy last month after the 30-year-old made only eight Premier League starts last season, with Raphael Varane, Lisandro Martinez and Victor Lindelof preferred in central defence. British media reported that West Ham had agreed a deal worth 30 million pounds ($38.01 million) for Maguire, who became the world's most expensive defender when United signed him from Leicester City for 80 million pounds in 2019. ""He has to fight for his place and he has the abilities to be a top-class centre back,"" Ten Hag told reporters. ""He is the best for England and I assume he will be best for us, but he has to prove it. ""When he is not confident enough to go in and fight, then he has to go. He has to make a decision. But I am happy with him ... You need high-level players who are maybe not starting, but that can change.""

"Manchester United captain Harry Maguire should be available to face Melbourne Victory after missing their 4-0 thumping of Liverpool, manager Erik ten Hag said Thursday. The England defender was a conspicuous absence in the first game of the Red Devils' pre-season tour in Bangkok on Tuesday, watching from the sidelines after a knock in training. In his place, Raphael Varane, Victor Lindelof, Eric Bailly and Alex Telles all got time in central defence instead. But Ten Hag, who took over in May after finishing a successful spell at Ajax, said Maguire should play at least 45 minutes in front of expected bumper crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. ""He is tomorrow available,"" said Ten Hag, whose side also face Crystal Palace and Aston Villa in Australia. ""We will see (how long for). I think he can play half a game."" United head into Friday's match with no fresh injury concerns reported. Ten Hag pointed to a crop of youngsters, like Ethan Laird, Hannibal and Alejandro Garnacho, ""with huge potential"". ""Now it's about getting the potential out of them,"" he said, with all three no doubt eager to get an opportunity on Friday. Rashford 'looking forward to getting more games' under Ten Hag Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford said Thursday he was relishing a ""fresh start"" under new coach Erik ten Hag, keen to put a forgettable last season behind him. The England international had a frustrating and disappointing 2021/22 campaign, dropped by Gareth Southgate from the national team amid a form dip at the Old Trafford club. But he has been working hard over the English summer and, injury free, is on his first full pre-season tour since breaking into the senior Red Devils squad. ""For me, it's a fresh start and something I'm looking forward to,"" he said in Melbourne ahead of their tour game against Melbourne Victory after a 4-0 win over Liverpool in Bangkok this week. ""I'm in a good place right now. I'm just looking forward to getting more games under my belt."" The good place comes is courtesy of a rare, prolonged summer break with no international duty. ""It's been a bit unnatural for me to have such a long break in the summer, just under four weeks and I could have a break physically and mentally,"" said the 24-year-old. ""It's massive to have a full pre-season. This is the first year I've been with the team from the beginning and I already feel a lot better. ""I think the first two-and-a-half weeks of training have been good, we're (United) a lot fitter than we were last season and also we're making mistakes along the way so we have a lot of room for improvement."" Asked about his confidence after a season in which United finished a disappointing sixth in the Premier League, Rashford said it was never easy playing on an underperforming team. ""I always say to myself it's a lot easier to make mistakes in a team that's winning,"" he said. ""The last game against Liverpool for example we won but we made a lot of mistakes. Individually it's the same. When you're losing it's difficult -- we're all sportsmen and we don't like to lose. ""When that happens you have to refocus and try to win the next game.

"Thousands of people lined the streets of Manchester on Monday to pay their final respects to Manchester United and England great Bobby Charlton, who died last month at the age of 86. The 1966 World Cup winner, widely regarded as one of England's greatest players, died after an accidental fall at his care home on October 21. Crowds clapped warmly and held banners as the funeral cortege drove past United's Old Trafford ground on its way to a private funeral service at Manchester Cathedral. The hearse passed the famous ""United Trinity"" statue immortalising Charlton, Denis Law and George Best and through a guard of honour made up of members of the club's Under-18 and Under-21 squads. There were numerous black-and-white photographs depicting Charlton's long and illustrious career as a player and then as a director at the club. Around 1,000 guests including former United manager Alex Ferguson, England boss Gareth Southgate and Prince William, the Football Association president, arrived for the private funeral service, which started at 1400 GMT, along with current and former players. Former United captain Bryan Robson, speaking outside the cathedral, told the BBC: ""For a player to win the World Cup, win the Champions League and have such a long and successful career you've got to be a fantastic player to be able to achieve that. ""But Sir Bob wasn't just a great player, he was a great person and had time for everybody."" Former teammate Alex Stepney said Charlton remained humble despite his success. ""Nothing was over his head or anything like that, it was all about playing for Manchester United,"" he said. ""Even on international duty it was about winning and that was what Bobby Charlton was all about. A humble guy, a great family man. It never went to his head."" World Cup winner Charlton was a key member of England's victorious 1966 World Cup team, alongside his late brother Jack. He won 106 caps for England, scoring 49 goals. He also enjoyed great success at club level with United, who became the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, a decade after he survived an air crash in Munich, in which eight of his teammates were killed. Charlton returned to the club with which he had made his name as a director in 1984 and remained a major figure there until his later years. In 2020, it was announced he had been diagnosed with dementia and as the disease took hold he stopped attending matches at Old Trafford. Ferguson, who guided the club back to the pinnacle of European football, described the former midfielder as a ""tower of strength"" during his 26-year spell as manager. In a eulogy published in the matchday programme ahead of the derby against Manchester City, Ferguson wrote: ""People loved him because of all those thunderbolt goals, but it was more than that. My dad used to say that humility in success is a sign of greatness, and that was Bobby.

"Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford's birthday party celebrations hours after the 3-0 defeat by Manchester City last weekend were ""unacceptable"" manager Erik ten Hag has said. England's Rashford, who turned 26 on Tuesday, held a pre-planned party at an exclusive Manchester nightspot on Sunday, something that did not go down well with the United boss. ""It is unacceptable. I told him. He apologised and that is it,"" Ten Hag told a press conference on Friday. ""So he makes a mistake but it doesn't say he (is not) fitting in. He makes one mistake but also off the pitch what he is doing. I am sure he is doing everything right to help the team and to perform and let us win,"" he added. The Dutchman said Rashford is available for Saturday's game at Fulham after the issue was dealt with internally. United are languishing in eighth place in the Premier League with 15 points from 10 games, 11 points adrift of leaders Tottenham Hotspur. Fulham are 14th on 12 points. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Alejandro Garnacho's spectacular strike for Manchester United on Sunday could well be the goal of the season, his manager Erik ten Hag said, but he said it was too soon to be comparing his young player with the likes of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo. The 19-year-old scored with a stunning overhead kick in the third minute to fire United to a 3-0 victory over Everton at Goodison Park, leaping to meet Diogo Dalot's cross with an acrobatic scissor kick into the top right corner that instantly drew comparisons with former United striker Rooney. ""The season, still many games to play, but probably already the goal of the season,"" Ten Hag told reporters. ""It was incredible."" The Argentinian teen said he himself couldn't believe he had scored. ""I didn't see how I scored, I just listened to the crowd and said 'Oh my god,'"" Garnacho told NBC. ""One of the best goals I've scored, I'm very happy."" The strike echoed goals by Rooney and fellow former United striker Cristiano Ronaldo, particularly Rooney's bicycle-kick stunner during the 2011 Manchester derby. ""I can't believe it,"" former United captain Gary Neville said on the Sky Sports broadcast. ""I don't think I've ever been in a stadium where I've seen an overhead kick as good as that – and I was there on the day that Rooney scored his in the Manchester Derby."" Ten Hag, however, was uncomfortable comparing Garnacho so quickly with two of the club's biggest names of recent years. ""Don't compare,"" said the manager, who served a one-game suspension on Sunday and so was not on the touchline. ""I don't think it's right. They all have their own identity, but for Garnacho to go that way, he has to work very hard. And you have to do it on a consistent basis. And so far, he's not. ""But he has definitely high potential to do some amazing things. It is not the first time we saw this. But if you want to be a player like Rooney or Ronaldo, you have to score 20, 25 goals in the Premier League and that's not easy to get. But potential, he has."" The goal silenced the Goodison Park crowd except for the travelling United supporters who loudly sang ""Viva Garnacho."" Even Everton manager Sean Dyche marvelled at what he called a ""lifetime goal."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Manchester City got back to winning ways with a 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Saturday thanks to first-half goals by Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland. After back-to-back league defeats, City were cruising to victory but Ansu Fati's 73rd-minute reply for Brighton threatened to make it an anxious finale at the Etihad Stadium. Alvarez opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a scuffed shot following great work by Jeremy Doku. With influential midfielder Rodri back from suspension, City dominated the first half and Haaland took advantage of sloppy Brighton play to smash in City's second after 19 minutes. City should have added to their total but Brighton made things interesting when Fati slotted home and the hosts ended with 10 men after Manuel Akanji was shown a second yellow card deep in stoppage time. Akanji will miss next week's Manchester derby. Victory lifted champions City back to the top of the table with 21 points from nine games, although Arsenal could go top with a win at Chelsea in a later kickoff. There was clear relief after almost 10 minutes of stoppage time for City's players and manager Pep Guardiola who had only lost three successive league games once in his career. City were not back to their fluent best but Brighton, who dropped to seventh, deserve credit for the way they stretched the hosts after such a poor start. Doku was again preferred to Jack Grealish and the Belgian's pace was a constant thorn in Brighton's side. It was his teasing run down the left and cut back that helped City open the scoring although Alvarez's strike was far from flush but evaded Jason Steele. Haaland had gone almost a month without a goal for City but he needed no second invitation to end that dry spell as Brighton made a mess of a throw-in deep in their own half and the Norwegian was allowed through to fire past Steele for his 45th Premier League goal in 44 games. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Erik ten Hag rode to the defence of under-fire goalkeeper Andre Onana on Friday as he claimed the Cameroonian's stats prove he is among the Premier League's best. Onana's start to his United career has been riddled with high-profile errors in the Champions League that have put the Red Devils on the brink of a group stage exit. He was at fault as two Hakim Ziyech free-kicks kickstarted a Galatasaray fightback in a 3-3 draw in Istanbul on Wednesday. That took United's tally of conceded goals in their five Champions League games to 14. But it has been a different story in the Premier League as Onana has let in just 16 goals in 13 matches. And Ten Hag pointed to figures which show the former Ajax stopper is second in the English top flight for saves made, save percentage and goals prevented. ""If you analyse it well then you see he is the second-best goalkeeper in the Premier League based on stats,"" Ten Hag, who championed Onana's signing from Inter Milan for £47 million ($59 million) in July, told a press conference on Friday. ""He's doing well. Also, he knows that in the Champions League he makes some mistakes, but all over you see the first five months he is doing particularly well."" United's Premier League revival after five wins in six games faces a stern test on Saturday as they travel to Newcastle. But Ten Hag quashed any suggestion that Onana's place in the side is under threat. ""You have seen how he is reacting on a bad performance like in (Bayern) Munich. At Burnley (three days later) he was outstanding,"" added Ten Hag. ""He is a strong character, he is a personality and he will deal with it."" United's recent run has taken them above Newcastle in the table into sixth. But all of their eight Premier League wins this season have come against sides in the bottom half of the table. By contrast, they have lost all four meetings against teams in the top half. And Ten Hag recognised his players need to rise to the challenge when facing strong opposition. ""We have to rise to the occasion, be our best against them because the way they play is very organised,"" he said on the trip to Newcastle. ""I really respect them. It's a difficult team to play but it's a good challenge and I like to play against it."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino labelled his side ""soft"" after a 4-1 defeat to a depleted Newcastle on Saturday left the Argentine enraged. The Blues looked to have turned a corner in Pochettino's first season in charge with a 4-1 win at Tottenham and a memorable 4-4 draw against champions Manchester City before the international break. But the visitors crumbled in the second half at St. James' Park as Newcastle overcame an injury crisis that had left Eddie Howe without 13 first-team players. ""We had to come here, Chelsea, to show that it's going to be difficult for them to play, to win the game and to beat us,"" said Pochettino, who watched the game from the stands due to a touchline ban. ""But it was really easy in the way that we conceded and the way that we were so soft in every single challenge. We didn't show that we were playing for something important. ""That's what makes me angry and disappointed. We talk about that we are a young team and we have to learn, but I think these type of games make me very, very, very, very, very angry because it's about showing your personality and character."" Defeat leaves Chelsea down in 10th in the table despite spending over £1 billion ($1.3 billion) on new players in less than two years under the ownership of Todd Boehly's consortium. Raheem Sterling had cancelled out Alexander Isak's early opener to leave the score level at half-time. But Chelsea collapsed after the break as two goals in two minutes from Jamaal Lascelles and Joelinton put Newcastle in command. Chelsea captain Reece James was then sent-off for two bookable offences before Antony Gordon rubbed salt in Pochettino's wounds late on. ""We thought that we were ready to compete today, but we didn't in the way that the competition demands,"" added Pochettino. ""Even if Newcastle weren't great, it was an easy win."" Newcastle's attention now turns to putting together a team strong enough to stave off elimination from the Champions League when they visit Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. Defeat in the French capital will see the Magpies first experience of Europe's elite competition for 20 years end at the group stage. ""You look at the players who were missing and that was a giant performance from the players we have fit,"" said Howe. ""To be able to come together and give a performance like that speaks volumes for the character of the players we have, the leaders we have in the group and our ability to just focus on the present, on what's happening right now.""

"New Chelsea manager Mauricio Pochettino's wait for a first victory will go on for five more days at least as his side were beaten 3-1 away at West Ham United on Sunday. A header by Nayef Aguerd, Michail Antonio's goal on the break and a late penalty by Lucas Paqueta secured victory for West Ham who finished with 10 men after Aguerd was dismissed for a second yellow card midway through the second half. West Ham's first two goals were assisted by debutant James Ward-Prowse who signed from Southampton this month. Chelsea cancelled out Aguerd's goal with a well-taken equaliser by Carney Chukwuemeka in the 28th minute and only had themselves to blame for defeat as they dominated possession, missed chances and saw a penalty by Enzo Fernandez saved. Pochettino sent on the club's latest big-money signing Moises Caicedo in a bid to salvage something but he gave away the penalty which sealed his side's fate. West Ham have four points from their opening two games with Chelsea, who host Luton Town next Friday, on one. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pep Guardiola says Lionel Messi should have his own category at the Ballon d'Or but admitted the World Cup winner and Manchester City hotshot Erling Haaland would both be deserving winners of the prize. Messi, who recently left Paris Saint Germain for Inter Miami, is favourite to win the Ballon d'Or for a record-extending eighth time after leading Argentina to World Cup glory last year. Haaland could be his main rival after scoring 52 goals in 53 games to help City win the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup last season. Guardiola knows the qualities of both players better than most, previously coaching Messi at Barcelona and currently managing Haaland with City. ""Always I said that the Ballon d'Or should be in two sections, one for Messi, and after look for the other one, so Haaland should win, yes,"" Guardiola said on Friday. ""We won the treble because he scored 50 million goals but of course Messi, if you tell me the worst season for Messi is the best for the rest of the players. ""Both deserve it, so what can I say?"" Guardiola added: ""Egotistically, I would say I want Erling because he helped us to achieve what we achieved, I would love it, but I won't tell you it's unfair if Leo wins. ""It's nice that many players for Man City will be there for the first time in many years and challenging for these trophies. That makes us so proud for our organisation."" City are hoping to get back to winning ways against Brighton on Saturday after losing their previous two league matches against Wolves and Arsenal. City midfielder Kalvin Phillips, who has struggled for game time under Guardiola, this week admitted he needs to play more at club level as he seeks to retain his place in the England squad ahead of Euro 2024. That has increased speculation he could leave in January and Guardiola did not rule out the possibility. ""The transfer window is over, now we are here together. When we need a game with transitions, Kalvin is perfect,"" he said. ""When there is something you need to do, there are still one or two players who can do it better. That's the simple reason. ""He will be here until winter. After, I don't know what will happen because nobody knows once the window is open."" Guardiola admitted it was ""so important"" that Rodri can return this weekend after the influential Spain midfielder was badly missed during his three-match suspension following last month's sending-off against Nottingham Forest. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The FIFA Disciplinary Committee is set to open an investigation into the violent clash between Brazil and Argentina fans in their World Cup Qualifier clash at Maracana Stadium on Wednesday, Brazilian news outlet Globo reported on Wednesday. Article 17 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code, in its 2023 version, makes it clear that the home side and its governing body, the CBF, is solely responsible for the safety of the game. ""Home clubs and federations are responsible for order and security in and around the stadium before, during and after games. [...] They are responsible for incidents of any type,"" the article reads. Punishments can be fines, playing one or more matches without an audience (or with a limited audience), a ban on playing games at a particular stadium, an obligation to play on a neutral field or even deduction of points and expulsion from competitions. Brazilian and Argentine fans started fighting behind one of the goals during the national anthems, prompting police to charge at the travelling contingent with batons. Argentina fans responded by ripping up and throwing seats at the officers as other spectators panicked and came onto the pitch to escape the fighting. One Argentina fan lay on the field with a bloodied face before being taken from the stadium on a stretcher. The Argentina team went over to the terraces to try to calm the situation before leaving the pitch and returning to the dressing room. Argentina captain Lionel Messi accused the Brazilian police of brutality as the match was delayed by half an hour after clashes between police and visiting fans. ""It was bad because we saw how they were beating people ... The police, as it already happened in the Libertadores final, were once again repressing the people with nightsticks, there were players who had families over there,"" Messi said in a pitchside television interview. ""We went to the locker room because it was the best way to calm everything down, it could have ended in tragedy. ""You think about the families, the people who are there, who don't know what's going on and we were more concerned about that than playing a match that, at that point, was of secondary importance."" FIFA President Gianni Infantino condemned the incident on Wednesday. ""Without exception, all players, fans, staff and managers need to be safe and protected to play and enjoy football and I urge the competent authorities to ensure this is respected at all levels,"" Infantino said in a statement. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"In a battle between two South American giants, Argentina came out on top in flying colours against defending champions Brazil today in the quarterfinals of the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Indonesia. The Albicelestes, who are yet to taste the ultimate glory in the competition, won 3-0 at the Jakarta International Stadium, courtesy of captain and playmaker Claudio Echeverri leading from the front with a hattrick. Echeverri, known as El Diablito (the Little Devil), justified his reputation and was exemplary on the evening, orchestrating attacks – leading to his side's 18 shots on target against Brazil's 14 – and ending three of those successfully, starting in the 28th minute. Argentina went on to strike two more in the second half, the latter arriving in the 71st minute, sealing the deal in the South American 'clasico' -- registering their first-ever win against four-time winners Brazil in the tournament. The win arrives as a double delight for Echeverri and Co, who saw their senior team, led by Lionel Messi, edge a 1-0 victory against eternal rivals Brazil in Tuesday's ill-tempered contest, marred by violence in the stands of the Maracana Stadium in a World Cup qualifying fixture. In the semi-finals, Argentina will face off Germany on November 28 after a Paris Brunner's second-half penalty enabled the latter secure a 1-0 win over Spain earlier in the day. The ongoing 24-nation tournament -- boasting graduates in the likes of Luis Figo, Ronaldinho, Andres Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez, Neymar, among others -- began on November 10 and will conclude on December 2.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It has been three years since the death of Diego Armando Maradona. The news that was known on November 25, 2020 shocked the world and led the Argentine government to decree three days of national mourning. The star was at his house in the private neighborhood of San Andrés, in the Tigre district, and suffered a cardiac arrest while undergoing rehabilitation after having undergone surgery a month before for a subdural hematoma. The sad end of the footballing icon began on November 2. That day he had to be transferred to a clinic in La Plata due to a ""low mood that affected his diet ,"" but as the hours passed it was decided that he be taken to the Olivos Clinic for an emergency operation. This is how they detected the subdural hematoma in his head and he underwent surgery. He passed the operation successfully and his personal doctor Leopoldo Luque, who later found himself at the center of criticism for his actions, confirmed that he should remain hospitalized. Shortly after, on November 11, Maradona was discharged and it was decided that he continue his recovery at his home in Nordelta. However, the outcome was the most feared by everyone and almost a month after his birthday, he lost his life at the age of 60. On Tuesday, November 24, his nephew Johnny Espósito reported that he had gone to see him and that the cook Monona had left him crumb sandwiches for dinner, which were left intact in the room next to his bed. In turn, Ricardo Almirón , the night shift nurse, revealed that before being relieved he had verified that Pelusa was resting and was still alive. Since it was the fateful Wednesday, November 25, Gisela Madrid was the nurse who took care of Diego's health in the morning and claimed to hear that he was moving around 7:30, so she made the decision to let him rest and not carry out any checks. It is finally at 11:30 that the psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov and the psychologist Carlos Díaz arrive at the place to carry out the periodic visit with Maradona. To their surprise, upon entering the bedroom they realized that he was not reacting and immediately those in the house began to perform resuscitation maneuvers on him, but it was not enough. The autopsy detailed that Diego was in agony for 12 hours and if he had been treated earlier his death could have been avoided and it was confirmed that an ""acute pulmonary edema secondary to exacerbated chronic heart failure"" was what caused his tragic death. The presence of multiple ambulances at the door of the home in San Andrés around noon set off alarms and generated enormous concern. Clarín was the first media to confirm Diego's death and in a matter of minutes the news that no one wanted to hear was made known around the world. The sadness and shock was total and little by little the farewell messages began to arrive on social networks paying tribute to a unique icon in the history of not only sports but also the country. President Alberto Fernández quickly declared three days of national mourning and fans gathered in different parts of the planet to say goodbye to him. La Bombonera, the Argentinos Juniors stadium that proudly bears his name, the Obelisk, the Juan Carmelo Zerillo and the legendary corner of Segurola and Habana were some of the places of concentration on a day where the people took to the streets to say goodbye to one of theirs. In the last hours of Wednesday, his remains were laid to rest before family and friends, first at the Tres Arroyos wake house, located at Av. San Martín 1500 in La Paternal, and during the early hours of Thursday he was transferred to a massive wake at the Casa Rosada, where more than a million people were present. The coffin in which Diego's remains rest was wrapped in an Argentine shirt with the legendary number 10 that he wore when he played. Once finished after a chaotic day, a massive caravan accompanied the hearse that took Maradona's body to the Jardín Bella Vista Cemetery, in San Miguel, where he rests with his parents Doña Tota and Don Diego (who died in 2011 and 2015, respectively) with an inscription on his grave that he himself wished when talking about his death in his self-interview for ""La Noche del 10"" fifteen years ago: ""Thanks to the ball"". আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Brazilian attacker Vinicius Junior said it will be ""a bit difficult"" to be fit in time for Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Argentina, after limping off with a left-thigh injury against Colombia. ""Based on what the doctors have told me, it will be a bit difficult,"" the 23-year-old said after Brazil went down 2-1 in Barranquilla on Thursday. Vinicius left the field in the 27th minute of the World Cup qualifier against Colombia, with his side leading 1-0. ""I think it's the same injury as before. I felt a pain at the back of my thigh,"" he said, before adding that tests would be carried out on Friday. The Brazilian star missed a month of action after he injured his right thigh at the end of August in a league match for Real Madrid. He missed Brazil's first two South American qualifying matches against Bolivia and Peru in September. Contacted by the AFP, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) did not provide information on Vinicius' fitness. Brazil take on Argentina, who top the qualification standings, on Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro's Maracana Stadium. The home side, in fifth place, are already without goalkeeper Ederson, defender Danilo, midfielder and captain Casemiro and star attacker Neymar, all through injury. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Every four years as the FIFA World Cup comes around, people in Bangladesh and across the entire world cross their fingers for a clash between two of the most loved and decorated countries in world football -- Brazil and Argentina. But like all good things perhaps, this one specific match comes way too rarely on the grandest stage of all. The two teams have crossed paths only four times in the World Cup so far and never in a final, despite having won a combined seven titles and having appeared in 12 out of 21 finals. In fact, all four times they have met have come in either the second round or the Round of 16, the last of which came 32 years ago, when a cherubic Claudio Caniggia scored the winning goal for Argentina on the end of a brilliant run from Diego Maradona. The games between the two neighbours have produced a fair bit of drama and excitement, hence, it's only fair for people to long for a Brazil v Argentina match. That wish will come true if these two nations cross their respective hurdles tonight -- Brazil against Croatia and Argentina against the Netherlands -- in the first two quarterfinals of Qatar 2022. Given the confidence and spirit these two sides have shown on their way to the last eight, barring that extraordinary defeat for Argentina against Saudi Arabia, there won't be many betting against a South American clash in the semifinals. Even the two teams exuded confidence ahead of their respective matches. Why wouldn't they? Brazil are coming into this game on the back of a swashbuckling 4-1 win over South Korea, a performance reminiscent of the Jogo Bonito of the World Cup winning side of 1970 or that 1982 side, which has been dubbed as arguably the greatest side not to have won the World Cup. They've so far done justice to the hype that surrounds them every time, despite suffering a minor blip in a fairly inconsequential match against Cameroon in their last group stage game. There was enough evidence from the body language and overall attitude of both coach Tite and right-back Danilo at the pre-match press conference that they were enjoying their time in Qatar, while staying focused on their job. Tite, lovingly called 'the professor' by the people of Brazil for his philosophical views on football and other aspects of life, was in a chirpy mood, like you would expect from a man who knows his house is in order and there is no need for any unwarranted alert. Having praised his opponents, last edition's runners-up Croatia for their 'individual and collective technical ability and resilience', Tite was more inclined to talk about his own team and their mental state. The 61-year-old, who will step down after the World Cup no matter the result, once again defended his team's celebration against South Korea and his taking part in it, hinting he might do the same again as 'it is the culture of his country'. Argentina coach, Lionel Scaloni, meanwhile was more serious about his upcoming challenge against the Netherlands, whom the Albiceleste beat the last time they met at the World Cup, in the semifinals of the 2014 edition. ""Tomorrow's game is going to be a nice game to watch because there are two teams that propose to attack without neglecting their defense,"" said Scaloni, who guided his side to a first Copa America title in 28 years. Serious or frivolous, both coaches admitted that at this stage every match is like a final and every opponent is like a finalist. With one win more they step one step closer to the title. Both coaches know that these remaining three matches, if any of them go all the way, could help them leave a lasting legacy in footballing folklore.

"After hoisting his first World Cup trophy with Argentina in December, Lionel Messi said that tournament would be his last, but now it appears he's open to the possibility of playing in the 2026 event. Lionel Messi was a different kind of mood during the World Cup match against Netherlands and had a war of words with Dutch striker Wout Weghorst during his post-match interview following the match. Argentina’s World Cup-winning goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was greeted by a crowd estimated at 100,000 in his home town, Mar de Plata. The curtains closed on the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar on Sunday with the Lionel Messi-led Argentina clinching their third title by beating France in the final, but with barely very little time for the fans to let the euphoria sink in, the focus has promptly shifted back to club football. ""Muchachos, we can dream again..."" the hit song that accompanied Argentina on their conquest of the 2022 World Cup has found deep resonance in a country desperate for a feel-good moment. As the streets of the metropalitans and village Bangladesh are bustling with waving flags, chants, cheers for Lionel Messi and Argentina following their third World Cup victory in a breathtaking final against France on Sunday, Argentina Football Team’s official twitter handle thanked Bangladesh for their wonderful support they showered. Lionel Messi has gone one better again. Having broken the record for the most-liked post on Instagram, the World Cup-winning Argentine's celebratory post has proven so popular that it is now the most-liked social media post of all-time, across any social networking platform. Watching Sunday's World Cup final, Ahmed al-Salem was more emotional than most football fans when Qatar's emir placed a black and gold cloak over the shoulders of Argentina's victorious captain Lionel Messi. Several members of the France team that lost to Argentina in the World Cup final were subjected to ""hateful"" racist abuse on social media, the French Football Federation (FFF) said on Tuesday, adding it intended to file a legal complaint. Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi has been invited to ""eternalize"" his mark at Brazil's famous Maracana by leaving his footprints in the iconic stadium's Hall of Fame, the Rio de Janeiro State Sports Superintendence has said. Lionel Messi set yet another record on Tuesday after his Instagram post celebrating Argentina's World Cup win became the most-liked on the platform, breaking a nearly four-year-old record held by a photo of an egg. Lionel Messi’s World Cup fairytale lit up the year in football as heroics and heartbreak at the finals captivated fans and highlighted the growth of the world’s most popular sport despite the criticism of host country Qatar’s human rights record. France forward Kingsley Coman and midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni have been subjected to online racist abuse after missing their penalties in Sunday's World Cup final against Argentina, the BBC reported on Monday. Prior to the Qatar World Cup, Lionel Andres Messi had all but conquered everything for his country and the clubs he represented – prestigious titles, individual awards, accolades from teammates, opponents, and critics alike. Ballon D’Or winner Karim Benzema announced he was ending his international career on Monday, the day after France lost in the World Cup final to Argentina. Lionel Scaloni hardly ever shows emotion in the dugout. Whether his team scores a crucial goal or a spectacular one, he hardly moves a facial muscle, let alone unleash a joyous celebration like the ones you see from most coaches around the world. He sits there with a straight face, like a monk deep in meditation. ","sports"
"Balbirnie found Liton’s glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. According to the Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, it is not necessary for him to bowl if he has five to six different options in his arsenal. Mushfiqur Rahim’s stellar outing with the bat against Ireland in the one-off Test in Mirpur, which ended with Bangladesh winning by seven wickets today, saw him cross the 14000-run mark in international cricket. Previously, board president Nazmul Hassan had stated a numerous times that the board were not going to allow players to feature in franchise leagues during international assignments. Bangladesh handed Ireland a seven-wicket defeat as the home side chased down a 138-run target before the end of the second session on the fourth day of the one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur on Friday. Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s decision to not introduce himself into the bowling attack till the 66th over of the first innings against Ireland raised a lot of questions on the opening day of their lone Test in Mirpur. Shakib, eventually, bowled only three overs on that day. Ireland had appeared to be on the verge of defeat with top-order failing to counter Shakib Al Hasan and Taijul Islam in the final session on day two. From there, they found a way on day three to make Bangladesh toil on a hot and humid day. Few would have given Ireland to avoid an innings defeat, let alone stage a turnaround to keep the Mirpur Test alive as they began day three at 27 for four, but the visitors managed to claw their way back into the one-off Test against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium today. Ireland wicketkeeper-batter Lorcan Tucker joins a long list of cricketers who managed to score a century on Test debut as Ireland continue to stage an exceptional turnaround against Bangladesh in the third day of the one-off Test in Mirpur today. Following a productive first session on the third day, Ireland were on course to claw back their way into the match against Bangladesh in the one-off Test in Mirpur. However, the loss of set batter Harry Tector has given the visitors a big setback. Bangladesh remain in a strong position as their lead stretch past 100 on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh’s veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim brought up his 10th Test ton during the Tigers’ lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan’s wait for his sixth Test ton continues as the star all-rounder fell just 13 short of the landmark score in their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Despite losing Mominul Haque early, Bangladesh dominated the morning session on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan and veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim started rebuilding after Mominul Haque departed early on the second day of their lone Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Candy Lappin, his mother was enjoying the cricket too, having seen the young players turn into international stars. Bangladesh spinners Taijul Islam and Mehedi Hasan Miraz combined to scalp three wickets in quick succession to leave Ireland struggling in the second session on the opening day of their one-off Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Oddly enough, Bangladesh Test skipper Shakib Al Hasan is yet to introduce himself even after over 40 overs bowled during the Tigers’ one-off Test against Ireland at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today.

"Liton Das was donning a sunglass in the first innings but did not wear one as he came out to open in the second innings. Mark Adair got the better of Liton in the second innings after a rapid start and the bowler gave a send-off to Liton, motioning to put on his sunglasses to watch where the ball had gone. Adair bowled a bouncer which hit Liton's helmet before the ball ricocheted off Liton's bat to crash on to the stumps. Liton was perplexed for a moment, wondering how the ball went behind and hit his stumps to castle him but Adair, who enjoyed the wicket, told Liton to put on the glasses again. Asked on Adair's send-off, Balbirnie found Liton's glasses while batting in the first innings to be quite amusing. ""I never played against someone who batted with sunglasses on. It looked pretty cool. I wouldn't be doing it myself. I'm not sure whether there was a prescription. He played nicely in the first innings but it was just a bit of fun. We were trying to create an uncomfortable atmosphere,"" Balbirnie said at the press conference today. Liton departed for a 19-ball 23 but his innings provided the momentum to avert pressure during the chase. Najmul Hossain Shanto was coming in next after Liton and Ireland skipper said that they wanted to create pressure on the batter coming in to the crease. ""With Shanto obviously we tried to create something cause he was gone first ball for a duck in the first innings and we tried to create a bit of pressure for him there cause we knew in order to win the game, we had to do something different. Yeah Mark enjoyed that one,"" Balbirnie said. Bangladesh went on to win with seven wickets in hand after unbeaten knocks of 51 and 20 from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mominul Haque respectively. Asked if they felt that they could have won, Ireland captain said all the pressure to win was on Bangladesh. ""100 per cent (felt we had a chance of winning this morning). The wicket was still pretty good, Ebadot bowled well, he attacked the stumps but we were confident we could get a 180 lead. Our message was all the pressure was on Bangladesh. If they had lost this game there would have been a lot more people in this press room. Even if they were 100 for none chasing 130 the pressure was on them, no-one expected Ireland to come here and win a Test match. We knew we needed early wickets but the way Liton played took the momentum away but we stuck at it, created chances, but it just wasn't to be,"" he added on Ireland's fight. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Andy Flower was appointed head coach of the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Friday replacing Sanjay Bangar, with the Indian Premier League (IPL) side also releasing their director of cricket operations Mike Hesson. Former Zimbabwe captain Flower has been a sought-after coach who guided England to the T20 World Cup title in 2010 and has also tasted success in franchise-based competitions in England, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Flower has coached Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL and at Bangalore he will reunite with Faf du Plessis, having worked with the South African at St Lucia Kings in the Caribbean Premier League. ""I'm truly honoured to represent a franchise of their size, reputation and standing,"" Flower said in a statement issued by the RCB, who have yet to win the IPL title despite the presence of marquee players such as Virat Kohli. ""RCB have an unrivalled fan following and I can't wait to fully experience the atmosphere in the Chinnaswamy next season."" ""I'm particularly excited to be reunited with Faf.

"The Indian Premier League's (IPL) stature as the world's top Twenty20 competition is secure despite the emergence of similar franchise-based tournaments around the world, its chairman Arun Singh Dhumal told Reuters. The IPL, with an estimated brand value of $8.4 billion, continues to attract the world's top players and coaches with the kind of money T20 competitions in Australia and England can only dream of. The landscape is changing, however, with lucrative leagues starting up in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa this year, while Major League Cricket gets underway in the United States next month. Even if players now have more choice where to take their talent than ever before, Dhumal was confident the IPL would retain its primacy in franchise cricket. ""We don't see anyone else as our competition, there is none even close to IPL,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""Our best wishes to all the boards starting their own T20 leagues, but I don't think any of them can be a threat to IPL."" Dhumal's conviction stems from the strong viewership numbers for this year's IPL, which concluded on Monday, especially from the league's digital partner. Jio Cinema, in a statement on Wednesday, said more than 120 million unique viewers had tuned in to watch Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans in a dramatic final, with a peak concurrency of 32.1 million. ""It has been a phenomenal success, and largely because of the sheer competitiveness of this year's tournament,"" Dhumal added. ""Most of the matches went down to the wire and there were plenty of last-over thrillers. We got a phenomenal response from the fans. Our viewership grew manifold and our broadcast and digital partners both are excited. ""Even the in-stadia experience of the fans has been phenomenal, and going forward it's only going to get better."" The IPL's popularity has remained undimmed since its 2008 inception and the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) policy of not allowing its own players to participate in foreign leagues has helped ensure its preeminence. Dhumal said the IPL would remain a 10-team event but the number of matches, currently 74 per season, might go up to 94 if it gets a bigger window in the calendar prepared by the governing International Cricket Council (ICC). While the IPL offers life-changing money for most of its participants, the global cricketers' association has called for players to receive a bigger share of the league's revenue. Dhumal, however, said there had been no discussions about increasing the $11.5 million salary cap for each franchise. ""We will have to consult the franchises and team owners before taking a call,"" he said. ""While we still have 10 months before the next IPL, a lot of discussion will have to take place before anything like that happens."" Dhumal, who is also a senior BCCI official, also dismissed media reports that the IPL was planning to stage matches in Saudi Arabia or to help the oil-rich country set up its own T20 league. ""It's the ICC's job to grow the game outside the traditional pockets,"" Dhumal said. ""BCCI has helped nations in the past but as far as a T20 league in Saudi Arabia is considered, it's all speculation."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Trent Boult giving up his New Zealand Cricket contract is another sign of a revolution sweeping through the game -- a change happening not at the leisurely pace of a test match but at the breakneck speed of a Twenty20 innings. A key figure in the teams that won the inaugural World Test Championship and finished runners-up in three limited overs World Cups, Boult will from now on have a ""significantly reduced role"" with the Black Caps. Read full story The left-arm quick requested the release from his contract so he could spend more time with his young family but, a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) statement said, the 33-year-old also wanted to make himself available for ""domestic leagues"". A crammed international calendar in three formats of the game and the added strain of playing in biosecure bubbles during the COVID-19 pandemic have pushed players like Boult to breaking point. England talisman Ben Stokes quit the 50-overs format last month citing an ""unsustainable"" workload, while South Africa's Quinton de Kock dropped test cricket last year. All three have, however, found time to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the trailblazer of the lucrative Twenty20 ""domestic leagues"" now proliferating around the world. ""The decisions that Quinton de Kock, and specifically Trent Boult, have made, point to a future of shorter international careers and more players happy to be part of the gig economy,"" tweeted commentator Harsha Bhogle. ""With young families, it isn't easy to play both, international cricket and T20 leagues."" Mushrooming franchise cricket, including upcoming leagues in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, is making it an easy choice for some players. Bhogle said it would be unfair to criticise players who prioritise franchise cricket for ""greed and opportunism"". ""Do remember cricketers finish their playing careers when most others are entering their best phase,"" he added. ""And we change jobs that offer more money and convenience, no?"" GUNS-FOR-HIRE Several West Indies players have effectively turned into Twenty20 freelancers, earning lot more from franchise cricket than they could have playing international cricket. The uncertainty around the availability of their key players has frustrated West Indies chief coach Phil Simmons ahead of this year's Twenty20 World Cup in Australia. ""It hurts. There's no other way to put it,"" an exasperated Simmons said on Wednesday. ""But what can you do? I don't think that I should be begging people to play for their countries."" NZC chief executive David White ruled out more New Zealand cricketers following Boult's example. ""They are still talking about test cricket - and performing for New Zealand - as being incredibly important,"" White told Cricinfo website. ""The other thing is that if you are going to get a big offer from a big league, you've got to be a successful international cricketer."" The International Cricket Council (ICC) discussed the growth of T20 leagues in its annual general meeting in Birmingham last month but anyone looking to them for leadership might be disappointed. The governing body has put the onus on the member boards to find balance between domestic and bilateral cricket to better manage the workload of players. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult is available and likely to be selected for this year's 50-overs World Cup in India despite declining the offer of a national contract, head coach Gary Stead said on Thursday. Boult, who opted out of his contract last year, was not included in New Zealand's updated list of contracted players on Thursday but had instead signed a ""casual playing agreement"", New Zealand Cricket said. ""He has indicated he's available for the World Cup,"" Stead told reporters. ""He's one of the best ODI bowlers in the world so barring injury, I think it's highly likely he would be part of our squad."" Boult and Tim Southee formed one of the most feared strike partnerships in international cricket over the last decade, helping New Zealand to the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021 and the finals of the last two 50-overs World Cups. However, Boult was released from his contract last August at his own request, saying he wanted to spend more time at home with family and less time travelling. Although picked for an ODI series in Australia last year and the T20 World Cup that followed in the same country, Boult was snubbed by selectors through New Zealand's home summer, even when an injury crisis hit the squad's pace bowling stocks during the test series against England. Stead said Boult's international availability outside the World Cup was still being discussed and was dependent to some extent on his T20 league commitments. But the coach left the door open for a possible return to the test squad for the left-armer, who has taken 317 test wickets and more than 250 in limited overs internationals. ""We're just still working through that ... The conversations are positive, though,"" said Stead. ""It's just marrying up what works and what 'readiness' means from our perspective around test cricket, in particular."" While Boult remains firmly in New Zealand's plans, spinner Ajaz Patel was dropped from the Black Caps' list of 20 contracted players after featuring in two tests and no white ball internationals last season. Adam Milne was awarded one for the first time in five years, though, after a productive international season boasting 24 wickets in 16 white ball matches. Players offered New Zealand contracts for 2023-24: Finn Allen, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Adam Milne, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Glenn Phillips, Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Blair Tickner, Neil Wagner, Kane Williamson, Will Young. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pat Cummins may be undecided about his future as Australia's one-day international captain after the World Cup but few of his compatriots will be urging him to stand down after his efforts in India. Australia have had no shortage of contributors through the tournament, with Adam Zampa taking 22 wickets and David Warner scoring a pile of runs. Cummins's courage under fire and unlikely heroics with the bat, however, have been vital in his team's revival following back-to-back defeats at the start of the campaign. An unbeaten 14 against South Africa in Thursday's semi-final saw Cummins walk off the ground with bat in hand and victory secured for the second time in the tournament. In the first, he teamed up with Glenn Maxwell to save Australia against Afghanistan, hanging tough in an epic knock of 12 not out from 68 balls to allow his all-rounder team mate to thrash a double century for victory. Australia has had its fair share of serious skippers, from ""Captain Grumpy"" Allan Border to the stone-faced Steve Waugh. Cummins, by contrast, has kept the mood light in the dressing room and out at the crease, where the banter flows freely with batting partners no matter how high the stakes. ""I think it's easier out there than sitting in the dugout,"" Cummins said of batting in a tense finish. Having led Australia to their first World Test Championship triumph in June, Cummins could become the fourth Australian captain to secure the global 50-over title on Sunday, joining Border, Waugh and Ricky Ponting. SCEPTICISM For all Australia's success in the test arena since Cummins replaced Tim Paine as skipper two years ago, his captaincy has not always been universally admired. He has leant heavily on former captain Steve Smith and coach Andrew McDonald, while battling scepticism in Australia that a fast bowler can -- or should -- juggle leadership duties. Australia's failure to win the Ashes in England earlier this year after leading 2-0 saw him come in for stiff criticism from former players and pundits who nit-picked at tactical decisions. Even his place in the World Cup squad was questioned given his relatively modest bowling figures in ODIs compared to fellow quicks Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. Former captain Michael Clarke dropped a bombshell that Cummins was set to be dropped after the opening defeats to India and South Africa. It proved a red herring. Cummins took two vital wickets in the next match against Sri Lanka, ran out another batsman with a sensational piece of fielding, and set Australia on its path to eight successive wins. With Cummins in charge, victory over hosts India in Ahmedabad on Sunday would mark Australia as one of the great cross-format teams of the modern era. ""The team has done really well and if you win a World Cup that's a real feather in your cap as a leader,"" Steve Waugh told News Ltd media on Friday. ""That's a legacy you can leave. You can never have that taken away from you. ""It's a big moment for him and the team."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Australian cricket team's uncanny ability to turn up at their very best when the stakes are the highest was on full display in the final of the ICC World Cup against India on Sunday. Bowling first, Pat Cummins and his team looked unfazed by the sea of blue at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, as they chipped away at the star-studded Indian batting line-up and eventually restricted them to 240. But the innings that ended so favourably for the Aussies had begun in a starkly different manner. In fact, nine overs into the innings, it was India who were looking on their way to posting a big total, mainly thanks to their captain Rohit Sharma. But a moment of magic from Travis Head flipped the momentum of the innings and eventually the outcome of the final as Australia won the contest by six wickets to clinch their sixth World Cup title. Rohit was batting on 37 off 27 balls as India were well placed on 66-1 when part-time spinner Glenn Maxwell came into bowl the final over of the first Powerplay. Rohit, presumably trying to maximise the final over of field restrictions, decided to target the off-spinner. He charged down the track and slammed a huge six and then followed it up with a four. Had the swashbuckling opener decided that 10 runs from boundaries were enough in that over, the rest of the innings could've panned out very differently. But Rohit sought to hit another boundary, took a few steps forward, and tried to heave the ball over the in-field but mistimed his shot. Right as the ball left the bat, Head, positioned at cover point, started running back while always keeping his eyes on the ball. He then put in a full-stretch dive to grab the ball safely. This wicket silenced the 132,000 fans in the stands and put a stop to a promising partnership between Virat Kohli and Rohit. Just four balls later, Shreyas Iyer departed, and slowly but surely Australia took the wind out of India's innings. Head's brilliant catch wasn't an aberration but the norm in the final as the Australian players were on their toes throughout the innings. The fielders inside the 30-yard circle didn't let go of easy singles and the ones on the boundaries hardly let the ball hit the boundary cushions. The Aussie ground fielding was so clinical that India could only hit four boundaries from overs 11-50. Just as Head's moment of brilliance sparked the change of momentum, his commanding 137 off 120 balls sealed the fate of the final. Perhaps for the first time in their history, Australia came into a final of the World Cup as the underdogs. But the Cummins-led team came into the final with quiet confidence, which was apparent from their smiling faces from the moment they stepped on the field for the national anthems before the match. On the eve of the final, Aussie captain Cummins, with a calm demeanor, said that nothing would be better than silencing a packed Indian crowd in the biggest cricket stadium in the world. Australia, inspired by Head's impactful contributions and Cummins' ice-cool leadership, did exactly that. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former star batter Adam Gilchrist on Monday rated Australia's World Cup triumph as one of his country's ""finest"" cricket wins after they beat hosts India to earn a sixth one-day international title. Opener Travis Head starred during the final in Ahmedabad on Sunday by hitting a sparkling 137 off 120 deliveries, powering Australia to a convincing six-wicket win. Head joined Ricky Ponting and Gilchrist as the third Australian to score a century in a men's World Cup final. ""So proud of this Australian team and crew,"" Gilchrist wrote on X, formerly Twitter. ""To win another World Cup in the manner and circumstance they have is one of the finest victories in our sporting history I reckon. ""Time to celebrate,"" added Gilchrist, who scored 149 not out in the 2007 World Cup final win over Sri Lanka in Barbados. It was the sixth time the Australian men's side has won the one-day international World Cup after victories in 1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015. Set a challenging 241 in the final, Australia slipped to 47-3 before Head smashed his second century of the tournament to steer his team home with seven overs to spare, ending India's dominant run of 10 unbeaten matches at the World Cup. Cricket Australia's chief executive Nick Hockley said the team deserved the title after beating the hosts in front of a huge crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium. ""This is another wonderful achievement by Pat Cummins and his team who have performed brilliantly in testing conditions and against strong opposition throughout the tournament,"" Hockley said in a statement. ""To beat the previously undefeated India before their passionate home fans is an achievement that sits comfortably alongside any of Australia's five previous ICC Men's Cricket World Cup finals victories."" Australia added the 50-overs crown to the World Test Championship title they won last June after beating India in the final in London. Hockley said winning both titles in the same year ""is a testament to the calibre of our players across all formats"". ""Together with the retention of both the men's and women's Ashes and a sixth victory in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup, there is so much to celebrate as we head towards another exciting summer of international cricket,"" he added. Darren Lehmann, who won the World Cup with Australia as both a coach and player, also offered congratulations ""to all players and support staff on the 6th WC Title,"" on X. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It was not known if Pat Cummins was searching 'How to silence a big, partisan crowd' as the Australia captain entered the press conference room fiddling with his phone but he conceded that was pretty much the plan for the World Cup final against India. As if India's formidable batting lineup and fiery bowling attack were not handful enough, Australia will also have to deal with boisterous Indian fans, who will be egging on Rohit Sharma and his team on Sunday. Not a single seat in the 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium is likely to stay unoccupied when five-time champions Australia clash with an India side who are unbeaten in the tournament. Cummins said the best way to overcome a challenge like that was to embrace it. ""The crowd's obviously going to be very one-sided but in sport, there's nothing more satisfying than hearing a big crowd go silent and that's the aim for us tomorrow,"" he told reporters on Saturday. ""You've just got to embrace every part of a final ... you know in the lead-up there's going to be noise and more people and interest and you just can't get overwhelmed."" Beaten comprehensively by India in their opener, Australia strung together eight wins in a row to make the final against India, who have a perfect 10-0 record in the tournament. ""We know it's going to be a packed house. There's going to be 130,000 fans here supporting India. So it's going to be awesome,"" Cummins said. ""They've been playing really well, undefeated this tournament. But we know at our best we can give them a good shake."" Much of it will depend on how their new ball pair of Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood fare against India's top order. Starc bowled seven overs on the trot in their semi-final victory against South Africa sharing five wickets with Hazlewood. ""The opening partnership between him and Josh Hazlewood is going to be a big one for us,"" said Cummins, who is banking on their experience in global events organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). ""We saw what impact they can have in a game when they bowl like they did the other night. So, they're both big-game players, played in a few ICC finals now, so know what it takes."" Cummins felt Australia were yet to play a ""complete game"" in the tournament and hoped they have preserved it for the summit clash. ""There have been no huge wins. We've had to fight for every win, but we've found a way to win,"" Cummins said. ""I'm taking that confidence, knowing that we don't have to be at our absolute best to challenge any team, we can find a way through it."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A pro-Palestinian protester in India broke through security cordons to invade the pitch at the Cricket World Cup final on Sunday, stopping play briefly while he hugged superstar batsman Virat Kohli. Wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestinian flag, and a T-shirt with the slogan ""Stop Bombing Palestine"", the unnamed young protester ran onto the pitch in the 132,000-seat mega-stadium in India's western city of Ahmedabad. He was escorted off the pitch by security officers, and play swiftly resumed. Unbeaten hosts India have won 10 games in a row at the tournament as they seek a third World Cup title and were facing Australia in the final. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to attend the match along with Australian deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. Israel has vowed to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas in response to their October 7 attacks, which Israeli officials say killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and saw about 240 people taken hostage. The army's relentless air and ground campaign has since killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government. India, which has a long-standing call for an independent Palestinian state, has condemned Hamas and airlifted aid to Egypt for Palestinian civilians from the besieged Gaza Strip. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"New Zealand's hopes for the 50-over World Cup received a boost Tuesday, with Kane Williamson set to captain the Black Caps despite still recovering from a serious knee injury. Williamson has scored more than 6,500 runs in one-day international cricket and led New Zealand in their nail-biting defeat by England in the 2019 World Cup final. The star batter has been sidelined since April after surgery to repair torn ligaments in his right knee suffered while playing for Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League. ""Naturally, the preparation isn't ideal, but I didn't get too much of a say in it and the prospect of playing at another World Cup is really exciting,"" Williamson told New Zealand media. ""It's about ticking off those things I need to do for my knee and look forward to the competition."" The 15-man New Zealand squad will be named on September 11, but Williamson is already in after convincing head coach Gary Stead of his fitness. ""Kane has applied phenomenal dedication to his rehabilitation,"" said Stead. ""He's left no stone unturned in trying to get back playing cricket at the highest level. We are delighted to be in a place to select him."" New Zealand play England in the World Cup opener in Ahmedabad on October 5, but Stead said there isn't a specific timeline for Williamson's return. ""We want to give Kane every bit of available time to aid his recovery,"" he added.

"New Zealand fast bowler Doug Bracewell was Thursday sentenced to 100 hours of community service after pleading guilty to drink-driving after dogs ate his pet parrot. The 26-year-old was more than three times over the New Zealand legal limit when police pulled him over last month. It was his third drink-driving offence in 10 years. The court was told Bracewell decided to drive home from a function after receiving a call from his distressed partner who told him their pet cockatoo had been killed by dogs they were looking after for a friend. His lawyer, Ron Mansfield, said the offending was not about a disregard for road rules but came from a ""genuine concern"" for his partner. ""The cockatoo was of some significance to his partner and she was quite distraught,"" he said. Bracewell had previously issued a statement saying he made a ""massive mistake"" by driving home. ""This was no-one's fault but my own... I'm deeply embarrassed to have let down so many people -– be they family, friends, or cricket-lovers."" During sentencing, Judge Bridget Mackintosh noted Bracewell's two previous drink-driving convictions were ""somewhat historic"" but said his alcohol reading was ""relatively high"", and community work was appropriate. Bracewell, who has taken 72 Test wickets, could have faced up to two years in jail. He has a history of alcohol-fuelled incidents and was suspended for one Test in 2014 after going on a drinking spree with batsman Jesse Ryder, during which he broke a bone in his foot. In 2012, he missed the Test series against England after cutting a foot when he stood on broken glass while cleaning up after a party at his house. Ryder and Bracewell were also suspended for a match in 2012 after an altercation with a bar patron while drinking after a one-dayer against South Africa.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"England captain Eoin Morgan's fine century laid the platform for a 72-run win over South Africa in the day/night first one-day international at Headingley on Thursday. Victory over the Proteas, the world's number-one ranked ODI side, gave England a morale boost just a week before they host the Champions Trophy tournament featuring the world's top eight 50-over sides and put them 1-0 up in this three-match series. South Africa, set 340 to win, made steady progress while the experienced Hashim Amla and Faf du Plessis shared a second-wicket stand of 112. But they both fell in quick succession to leave the Proteas 149 for three. South Africa's innings never recovered and they were dismissed for 267 with five overs to spare. Earlier, Morgan's 107 -- his 10th ODI hundred for England -- was the cornerstone of the hosts' 339 for six. England had slumped to 198 for five but Morgan's sixth-wicket stand of 117 with fellow left-hander Moeen Ali, who made a dashing 77 not out on his return, turned the tide. Both batsmen struck five sixes apiece. Ali, omitted from the preceding 2-0 series win over Morgan's native Ireland, ended the innings in style when he hoisted the last ball, from Chris Morris, high over deep square leg. Ali was named man-of-the-match after also taking two wickets with his off-spin. South Africa skipper AB De Villiers opted to field first after winning the toss despite sunny blue skies above Headingley seemingly offering good batting conditions. His decision was quickly rewarded when Jason Roy (one) was caught behind off left-armer Wayne Parnell in just the second over. Both Alex Hales and England Test skipper Joe Root made runs on an easy-paced pitch before they each fell to Andile Phehlukwayo. The 21-year-old seamer struck with his first ball Wednesday when Hales, on 61, flat-footedly chased a wide ball and got a thin edge to wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock. Phehlukwayo then undid Root (37) with a bouncer the local hero mishooked to Amla. But Morgan twice lofted Phehlukwayo for six. Ben Stokes, back from impressing in the Indian Premier League, holed out for 30 and fellow IPL star Jos Buttler, replacing in-form Yorkshireman Jonny Bairstow, glanced to short fine leg on seven. Morgan, however, went to his hundred when he hooked fast bowler Kagiso Rabada over long leg for six. He holed out off Morris soon afterwards to end a 93-ball innings but Ali kept going as England plundered 102 runs in the last 10 overs. England then had an early breakthrough when dangerman de Kock fell for just five after skying Chris Woakes to opposing keeper Buttler. But Amla again proved a thorn in England's side with a typically elegant near run-a-ball 73. Fast bowler Mark Wood, however, removed the stylish South African when he had Amla lbw but only after England successfully reviewed Australian umpire Rod Tucker's not out call. There was rather less doubt when du Plessis was caught behind off Yorkshire fast bowler Liam Plunkett. De Villiers looked good while making 45 off 38 balls, including seven fours, but with his side falling behind the run-rate, he fell in similar fashion to several team-mate when he holed out off Ali. His exit left South Africa 225 for seven and the contest ended when tailender Rabada was caught behind off Woakes, who took four for 38. Before the match started, players and officials were joined by spectators in observing a minute's silence in memory of the victims of Monday's terror attack in nearby Manchester that killed 22 people and injured dozens more. The series continues at Southampton on Saturday and concludes with next Monday's match at Lord's. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Daryl Mitchell hit a sublime 190 as New Zealand amassed 553 before England started to fight back on a free-scoring second day of the second Test at Trent Bridge. Taking advantage of a docile pitch and lacklustre England bowling, Mitchell pummelled his way to his highest Test score. Tom Blundell joined the run spree with 106 in a 236-run fifth wicket partnership with Mitchell. New Zealand Test debutant Michael Bracewell scoring a brisk 49 as New Zealand took control in their bid to level the three-Test series after losing the opener at Lord's by five wickets. After quickly losing Zak Crawley in their reply, England recovered impressively as Ollie Pope (51 not out) and Alex Lees (34 not out) led them to 90-1 at the close. It was Mitchell's day as the journeyman with little Test pedigree, until this series, continued to seize his chance. Six years ago, Mitchell had a season playing for Blackpool in the Northern Premier League and scored just two centuries. The 31-year-old batsman arrived in England with just one Test hundred to his name since his 2019 debut, but now he has three following his 108 at Lord's. Mitchell's latest century came in 318 balls, including 23 fours and four sixes, with England dropping him for the second time in the match just after he reached his ton. New Zealand showed why they are the Test world champions, ruthlessly pressing home their advantage after scoring 318-4 on Friday. England fast bowler James Anderson had defended Ben Stokes' decision to bowl first, insisting the players backed their captain's ""aggressive"" call. Anderson's faith proved misguided as England gave a sloppy display just as bad as Friday's, which including three dropped catches and another close call that eluded two slip fielders. - Mitchell masterclass - Mitchell, who scored 81 on Friday after being dropped by Joe Root on three, moved within touching distance of his ton after pulling a short Anderson delivery for a crunching four. Having survived an lbw appeal from Matthew Potts, Mitchell brought up his century with a fortuitous edge off the England seamer. If that was an ungainly way to reach the hundred, it was out of character with the rest of Mitchell's classy innings. As he did on Friday, Mitchell went on the offensive against spinner Jack Leach but, on 104, he rode his luck with a lofty blow that was dropped by Potts as it trickled to the boundary. Blundell nudged a single off Leach to reach his third Test century from 191 balls, but he was dismissed when he drove Leach to Stokes at mid-off. Bracewell showed no signs of stage fright as he repeatedly battered Potts to the boundary before rain provided a merciful break for England. When play resumed, Anderson induced an edge from Bracewell and Root made the catch, ending the 91-run sixth wicket partnership. That exposed the New Zealand tail and Stuart Broad dismissed Kyle Jamieson (14) and Tim Southee (4) in the same over. Trent Boult added some lusty blows in a pesky last-wicket stand of 33 before Mitchell was caught behind off Potts. New Zealand's mammoth total was their highest ever score in England, beating their 551-9 declared in 1973. After watching New Zealand bat for nearly two days, Crawley lasted just six balls. Boult produced a beautiful piece of seam bowling that left Crawley in two minds as it clipped the edge and was caught behind by Blundell to leave England 6-1. The fielding woes that tormented England haunted New Zealand as well when Lees, on 12, was dropped in the slips by Mitchell off Southee. Pope settled England's nerves with an assault on Matt Henry that included two sumptuous fours and a top-edged six. Mitchell had benefitted from England's drops, but he was returning the favour, putting down Pope on 37 from an edge off Boult. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Trent Boult will have a ""significantly reduced"" role with the Black Caps after the star fast bowler asked to be released from his central contract, New Zealand Cricket said on Wednesday. The 33-year-old wants to spend more time with his family and make himself available to play in the domestic leagues. Boult has taken 317 wickets for New Zealand in 78 Test matches, 62 wickets in Twenty20 cricket and is top of the one-day international bowling rankings. ""This has been a really tough decision for me and I'd like to thank NZC for their support in getting to this point,"" said Boult, currently on New Zealand's tour of the West Indies. ""Playing cricket for my country was a childhood dream and I'm so proud of everything I've been able to achieve with the Black Caps over the past 12 years. ""Ultimately, this decision is about my wife Gert and our three young boys."" Boult said that he understood the move would reduce his chances of playing international cricket. ""I still have a big desire to represent my country,"" he said. ""However, I respect the fact that not having a national contract will affect my chances of selection. ""As a fast bowler I know I have a limited career span and I feel the time is right to move into this next phase."" Boult is fourth on the list of New Zealand's all-time Test wicket-takers behind Richard Hadlee, Daniel Vettori and his new-ball partner Tim Southee. ""Trent's made a massive contribution to the Black Caps since his Test debut in late 2011 and is now considered one of the best multi-format cricketers in the world,"" said NZC chief executive David White.

"Veterans Trent Boult and Martin Guptill were on Tuesday left out of the New Zealand cricket squad for home Twenty20 and one-day internationals against India beginning this week. The Black Caps host India in Wellington on Friday in the first of three Twenty20 games followed by a three-match one-day series. Both teams will be looking to overcome the frustration of losing in the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, which was won by England on Sunday. Guptill, 36, is replaced by rising young batsman Finn Allen, 23, while there is no place among the bowlers for left-arm paceman Boult. Earlier this year Boult, 33, asked to be released from his central contract and signed for the Melbourne Stars in Australia's lucrative Big Bash League. ""When Trent opted out of his contract in August, we indicated priority would be given to players with central or domestic contracts,"" said New Zealand coach Gary Stead. ""We're all aware of Trent's world-class ability, but at this time, we want to give opportunities and experiences to others,"" he added. Allen, who will be playing against India for the first time, has made eight one-day international appearances for New Zealand and has 23 T20 caps. He hit his highest score of 107 in a T20 match against Scotland earlier this year and scored 95 runs in five matches in the T20 World Cup, with a top score of 42 against Australia in New Zealand's opening match. ""The emergence and success of Finn at the top of the order in white-ball cricket means a guy of the class of Martin Guptill misses out,"" Stead said.

"Seamer Trent Boult is set to play international cricket again after being named Wednesday to the New Zealand ODI squad that will face England in September ahead of the World Cup. Boult, 34, is set to play his first 50-overs international for 12 months after being included in the 15-man squad to face England. He was left out by the Black Caps last year after turning down a central contract to play in Australia's lucrative Big Bash League. Boult is back in the squad and on course to play at October's ODI World Cup in India, after signing a ""casual playing agreement"" with New Zealand Cricket earlier this year. New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said it was ""great to welcome Trent back into our ODI unit as he begins his preparation towards the World Cup"". Boult is one of the world's best ODI bowlers, having taken 187 wickets at that level and a further 74 for his country in Twenty20 cricket. Kyle Jamieson, who has taken 72 wickets in 16 Tests, also returns to the New Zealand white ball squad after a back injury. Batter Tom Latham captains an experienced side that includes Test skipper Tim Southee, who is set to resume his bowling partnership with Boult. New Zealand play four ODI internationals against England between September 8 and 15. Stead said England will provide a good test for New Zealand heading into the ODI World Cup. ""England has been an impressive white ball side for quite some time and we're excited to be taking them on at home on the eve of the World Cup,"" he added. Kane Williamson, who ruptured knee ligaments in April, will train with the New Zealand squad in England as part of his rehabilitation. The Black Caps also play three Twenty-20 against the United Arab Emirates in Dubai from August 17-20 as well as four T20 matches against England from August 30 to September 5. New Zealand also has a three-game ODI series in Bangladesh at the end of September.

In all, he has been at the helm for 34 matches and overseen 24 wins including a run to the recent Asia Cup title when India crushed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final. Rohit is the only man to have made three double centuries in ODI cricket -- 208 against Sri Lanka in 2017, 209 against Australia in 2013 and the all-time highest of 264 facing Sri Lanka in 2014. He also has a double century in Test cricket for good measure.

"Mark Chapman completed a memorable few days in Edinburgh with an unbeaten hundred as New Zealand comfortably defeated Scotland by seven wickets in a lone one-day international on Sunday. Chapman followed his T20-best 83 in a 102-run thrashing of the Scots on Friday with 101 not out as New Zealand, beaten finalists in the last two 50-over World Cups, also proved too strong for their non-Test hosts in the longer white-ball format. The 28-year-old Chapman shared an unbroken fourth-wicket partnership of 175 with Daryl Mitchell (74 not out) as the Black Caps won with 25 balls to spare as they finished on 307-3 in reply to Scotland's 306 all out. ""The platform which the boys up top left us was awesome, it really set up the innings,"" said Mitchell. ""It was nice to get out in the middle with 'Chappy' and get the job done. ""His knock was awesome. It was nice to see him (Chapman) get an ODI hundred, I'm really stoked for him."" It was Chapman's second century in seven career ODIs following his unbeaten 124 against the UAE back in 2015. Martin Guptill (47) and opening partner Finn Allen, with exactly 50, got New Zealand's chase off to a sound start before the fourth-wicket duo eased New Zealand home despite off-spinner Michael Leask's 2-46. Leask had a fine match overall, making 85 and sharing a stand of 92 with Matthew Cross (53) that kept Scotland in the game after they had slumped to 107-5. All-rounder Leask faced 55 balls, including nine fours and four sixes.

"Ecuador romped to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Venezuela to reignite their 2018 World Cup qualifying challenge on Tuesday as Paraguay's bid suffered a setback with a defeat to struggling Bolivia. Ecuador, who had taken only a point from their previous two games, proved too strong for a Venezuela side buoyed by a 5-0 win over Bolivia last week. Arturo Mina headed Ecuador ahead in the 51st minute before the hosts cut loose in the final 10 minutes as Venezuela swarmed forward in search of an equaliser. Miler Bonanos tapped in from close range to complete a sweeping Ecuador counter-attack and make the game safe on 82 minutes. Four minutes later it was left to Everton's Enner Valencia to apply the coup de grace, finishing calmly past Daniel Hernandez to make it 3-0 after Venezuela were left exposed at the back once more. The win sees Ecuador move into third place in the South American standings with 20 points from 12 games. Uruguay, who play Chile later Tuesday, are second with 23 points while Brazil lead the standings with 24 points from 11 games. Brazil play Peru in Lima later Tuesday. In Tuesday's early game, Paraguay's hopes of battling into the top half of the table suffered a setback with a 1-0 defeat against Bolivia in La Paz. A Gustavo Gomez own goal in the 78th minute secured all three points for Bolivia, who moved off the bottom with the win. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Lionel Messi scored a majestic free-kick and set up two more goals as Argentina got their faltering 2018 World Cup qualification campaign back on track with a 3-0 win over Colombia. Barcelona maestro Messi on Tuesday curled in a superb free-kick from 30 yards in the 10th minute before providing the cross for Lucas Pratto's 23rd minute header. The tireless Messi then popped up in the 84th minute to set up Angel Di Maria's late goal as Argentina secured all three points. The two-time world champions had taken just two points from their previous four games to leave themselves languishing just outside the qualification berths in South America's marathon qualifying tournament. But Tuesday's victory puts Argentina back into the qualification positions in fifth place with six games remaining. Beaten 3-0 by Brazil last week, Messi and his team-mates came out determined to prevent Colombia from registering their first win on Argentine soil since 1993. Messi almost served up an opening goal after only six minutes, his perfectly flighted free-kick finding Manchester City defender Nicolas Otamendi whose diving header went just over the bar. Colombia hit back almost immediately with Radamel Falcao's header from a Juan Cuadrado cross going just over the bar before Wilmar Barrios saw his shot from outside the area blocked. But a boisterous Argentine crowd at San Juan's Estadio del Bicentenario did not have long to wait for the opening goal. A jinking Messi run ended with the Argentina captain being clumsily upended by Barrios around 30 yards from goal. Messi, who scored two free-kicks from a similar distance in the Copa America Centenario in June, had no hesitation in stepping up once again and his spectacular whipping effort crashed in off the underside of the bar with David Ospina beaten. It was Messi's 57th goal in his 116th game, giving him an average strike rate of just a fraction under a goal every two games. Colombia responded with another headed effort from Falcao that went just over in the 19th minute. But four minutes later Messi was to the fore again. A darting run on the right took him clear of the hapless Barrios, and his pinpoint cross picked out Pratto who calmly steered his header wide of Ospina for 2-0. The result was never in doubt thereafter, and Messi engineered his team's final goal with six minutes left, surging down the right flank and squaring for Di Maria who shot into the roof of the net.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Japan beat Saudi Arabia 2-1 in a foul-tempered qualifier Tuesday as a debatable Hiroshi Kiyotake penalty boosted their hopes of qualifying for a sixth successive World Cup in 2018. The Blue Samurai drew level with the Group B leaders on 10 points after a tempestuous clash in Saitama, where Kiyotake's spot kick and a Genki Haraguchi effort eased the pressure on under-fire coach Vahid Halilhodzic. Saudi Arabia pulled a late goal back through Omar Othman but it was not enough for the visitors to rescue a draw. ""Credit to the players for beating a good Saudi team,"" said Halilhodzic, whose future has been plunged into doubt after a poor run of form during the Asian qualifying campaign. ""This is a big victory for us but it was a deserved one,"" added the Franco-Bosnian after his side improved to 10 points from five games, with five remaining. ""We have had to stay strong to come back from some difficult situations and no doubt there will be more to overcome before we get to Russia."" Kiyotake converted on the stroke of half-time after Saudi defender Abdulmalek Al Khaibri was adjudged to have handled, despite replays showing Kiyotake's initial shot had struck him in the chest. The Saudis protested furiously to referee Muhammad bin Jahari of Singapore and scuffles broke out between the players, which continued as they disappeared down the tunnel at the interval. Haraguchi effectively killed off Saudi's hopes of pinching a point with a sharp finish after 80 minutes following a deft flick from substitute Shinji Kagawa. Othman's 90th-minute strike crept across the line in a moment of cruel irony for Japan, who had a similar effort disallowed in their 2-1 defeat to UAE. Saudi's chances of pulling off an improbable escape evaporated when captain Osama Hawsawi saw red for a clumsy challenge in injury time. Meanwhile, Koo Ja-Cheol's late winner spared South Korea's blushes as the hosts came from behind to beat Uzbekistan 2-1 in World Cup qualifying. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Since promising faces of the SAFF U-16 championship's winning squad such as Sarwar Zaman Nipu, Saad Uddin and Biswanath Ghosh show signs of flourishing in the top-flight professional football league, it comes as a big surprise to all that one of them has given up on the game in search of a living. The one in question is none other than Faisal Ahmed, the goalkeeper who helped Bangladesh win the title by thwarting the last penalty shot against India in August last year, who now plans to join Bangladesh Police as a constable. Soon after their success, the members of the squad were promised long-term training by the game's governing body, but no such steps have been taken as of yet. Even though the goalkeeper from Sunamganj could not be reached for comment, it is understood that he made the choice to change careers when left with no opportunity to play anywhere. “If football can't provide him meal [rice], why should he keep playing? I sent him to the Police to earn his bread and butter,” Faisal’s father Kiron Mia said, as quoted in a media report. Out of the 23-member squad, six players – Nipu, Saad, Biswanath, Shaown Hossain, Khalil Bhuiyan, Jahangir Alam Sajib – are with Bangladesh Premier League outfits while another member, Atiqur Rahman, plies his trade for the Bangladesh Championship League outfit Victoria SC. After completion of the SAFF U-16 Championship, eight players returned to BKSP while the rest looked for opportunities to play at different clubs at district level as well as in Dhaka. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Brazil coach Tite warned his side to be wary of Peru's attacking threats, Christian Cueva and Paolo Guerrero, when the two teams clash in World Cup qualifying in Lima on Tuesday. Cuevo matched Guerreo's qualifying tally of three goals by scoring in the 4-1 win away to Paraguay on Thursday, a win which moved Peru within three points of one of the region's four qualifying spots. ""Cueva, Guerrero, they are players that are... important,"" Tite told reporters on Monday. Five-times world champions Brazil top the 10-team South American standings on 24 points from 11 games, 10 clear of Peru, after they beat arch rivals Argentina 3-0 at home on Thursday. They also beat Peru by the same scoreline last year but midfielder Fernandinho adopted a cautious tone, with Peru only losing once at home in five qualifying matches. ""Peru is at home with the players that it has.

"Lionel Messi and Argentina's stars will have to take ""risks"" to beat Colombia and keep their World Cup hopes alive, coach Edgardo Bauza said ahead of their must-win clash on Tuesday. Messi used expletives to Argentinian media to highlight his anger after the Albiceleste lost 3-0 to Brazil last week. That left them in sixth place in the South American World Cup group -- and only four go through automatically. So far, they are only one point behind fifth place Chile, but anything but a win over Colombia could see a critical gap open up. Barcelona midfielder Javier Mascherano said after the Brazil defeat that Argentina had hit ""rock bottom"". With the pressure on him and the team, Bauza said it was good for Mascherano to show his anger, and he was still confident of reaching the 2018 finals in Russia. ""We need the team to improve in terms of production and this means they will have to impose themselves,"" Bauza said after the final training session Sunday. ""Colombia have big players, individuals with quality, and we have worked on countering that. We need to win and we need to take risks."" Bauza said the Argentinian team was still smarting from the Brazil defeat. And the two-time World Cup winners must rebound. ""There has to be a good match and we must win, no excuses. There is a strong desire in the squad."" Argentina had injury doubts over Gonzalo Higuain, Gabriel Mercado and Ever Banega. The coach said all players were ready to play but none was confirmed. While admitting Argentina's predicament was ""complicated"" he was not worried about his own future and harked back to his troubles when in charge at LDU Quito in Ecuador. ""In Quito, I was taken out of the stadium in a truck because they wanted to lynch me. In four months we were the champions of South America,"" he said. Quito won the Copa Libertadores in 2008. Colombia go into the match third with 18 points following a goalless draw with Chile last week -- still far from assuring qualification. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Polish Football Association (PZPN) president Cezary Kulesza hinted on Monday that former Portugal boss Fernando Santos would be named their new coach. The PZPN will hold a press conference on Tuesday to announce a new man in charge with Santos heavily linked with the role. ""See you tomorrow at the press conference at the national stadium,"" Kulesza said on Twitter in a message with a photo of himself alongside Santos attached. Kulesza also retweeted a congratulatory message from Polish Sports Minister Kamil Bortniczuk. ""Fernando Santos is a coach with a very good resume... successes... and work experience with huge stars,"" Bortniczuk said on Twitter. Former England and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard had also been linked with the position. Santos, 68, will succeed Czeslaw Michniewicz, who was sacked last month following a last-16 appearance at the World Cup in Qatar. Poland finished second in their group, beating Saudi Arabia, drawing with Mexico and losing to eventual champions Argentina. In the last 16 for the first time in 36 years, they went out after a tame 3-1 defeat at the hands of eventual runners-up France. Heavily panned at home for Poland's approach during the tournament, Michniewicz was further criticised by the PZPN for a ""lack of vision on the functioning and the future of the team"". Santos was previously Portugal coach, but quit last month following the team's shock World Cup quarter-final loss to Morocco. Appointed coach of Portugal in September 2014, Santos won the country's first major title at Euro 2016 and followed it up with the 2019 Nations League. However, his time in charge also saw last 16 exits at the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Herve Renard has been named France women's coach until 2024 and will lead the team at this year's World Cup, the French federation (FFF) said on Thursday. The 54-year-old Frenchman resigned as coach of the Saudi Arabia men's team this week after leading them to last year's World Cup in Qatar where they pulled off a shock group-stage win over eventual champions Argentina. Renard will unveil his squad for France's next two friendlies during his presentation on Friday. They face Colombia on April 7 and current Olympic champions Canada on April 11. The FFF sacked Corinne Diacre this month after captain Wendie Renard said she would not play at the World Cup if the coach remained in charge. Ranked fifth in the world, France will be looking to win a first World Cup at this year's showpiece tournament from July 20-Aug. 20 in New Zealand and Australia. Renard said after a 2-1 friendly loss to Bolivia in Jeddah last week that he felt he had taken Saudi Arabia as far as he could. The flamboyant Renard led Zambia to a shock win in the African Nations Cup final against Ivory Coast in 2012. Three years later, he claimed his second continental crown by guiding Ivory Coast to the title by beating Ghana in the final to become the first coach to lift the trophy with two different teams. Diacre's position had become untenable after Wendie Renard said that she would not play at this year's World Cup to preserve her mental health. Fellow internationals Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani followed suit soon, all saying they were taking a step back from the national team. Wendie Renard, widely considered one of the best defenders in women's football, played for France against Norway, Denmark and Uruguay last month. She was stripped of the captaincy by Diacre following France's quarter-final exit at Euro 2017, before regaining the armband in 2021. Diacre was also criticised at last year's European Championship in England for leaving senior players Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, their all-time leading scorer, out of her squad. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Inter Miami coach Gerardo ""Tata"" Martino confirmed Friday that star forward Lionel Messi will miss Sunday's match at Orlando City as he deals with a scar tissue issue from an injury with the Argentina national team. Messi, 36, and defender Jordi Alba did not practice Friday after they both exited in the first half of Wednesday's 4-0 win over visiting Toronto FC due to what Martino called muscle fatigue. ""It's bothersome,"" Martino said Friday about Messi's scar issue. ""I don't know if it hurts. I can't really explain as it's more a medical topic. ""It's probable it bothers him to the point, including mentally, that he isn't able to play freely."" Martino was not sure of the two players' availability for Inter Miami's match against the Houston Dynamo in the U.S. Open Cup final on Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The club already captured the Leagues Cup since Messi and others joined the roster. Miami is 8-0-4 in all competitions with Messi in the lineup, including 3-0-1 in MLS regular-season matches and now sports a 9-15-4 mark with 31 points. He has 11 goals and eight assists in all competitions (regular-season play, U.S. Open Cup, Leagues Cup). Both Messi and Alba sat out Miami's MLS contest on Sept. 16 at Atlanta United and won't play Sunday. Midfielder Sergio Busquets also missed practice Friday, while midfielder Jean Mota returned to training after being sidelined since April with an LCL injury. Another midfielder, Diego Gomez, has been unavailable because of a muscular injury. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Inter Miami boss Gerardo Martino provided an update on Lionel Messi's injury status after the Argentine missed his third straight Inter Miami game. Messi was once again missing from the Herons' matchday squad as they managed a 1-1 draw against New York City FC in a Major League Soccer clash on Saturday. This was the third straight Inter Miami game that the legendary forward has missed due to injury, which sparked concerns over him not featuring again this season. But after the match, manager Gerardo Martino provided an update on the star's injury, claiming that he is recovering fast. Speaking to reporters, Martino said: ""It is what I said. We're going to see this game to game. We're going to evaluate him [ahead of Wednesday's match] against Chicago. If he's going to be on the bench if he's going to be out of the bench, whether against Chicago or Cincinnati [next weekend]. We're going to see that. ""He's training on the field apart from the group, but he's feeling better and better … time will tell whether what I am saying is true or whether that person who made the report is right.""

"Inter Miami have appointed former Barcelona and Argentina coach Gerardo Martino to take charge of the Major League Soccer team, setting up a reunion with compatriot Lionel Messi. Martino, widely known as ""Tata,"" coached Messi with both the Spanish club and his country's national team. He was most recently in charge of Mexico and previously worked in MLS with Atlanta United, winning the title in 2018. Martino's arrival was widely expected after Miami, rock bottom of the Eastern Conference, fired their English coach Phil Neville. The 60-year-old will take over the team, from interim Javier Morales, once his work documentation has been completed. ""We are very happy to be able to welcome Tata to Inter Miami. We feel he is a coach who matches our ambitions as a club and we're optimistic about what we can accomplish together,"" said Inter Miami Managing Owner Jorge Mas. ""Tata has coached at the highest levels and we believe that experience will be hugely beneficial to us as we aim to compete for titles here,"" he added. Messi said earlier this month that he was joining Miami, co-owned by David Beckham, having opted to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract. The 60-year-old Martino played for and coached Argentine club Newell's Old Boys, where Messi played as a schoolboy. ""Tata is a highly respected figure in our sport whose track record speaks for itself,"" said Beckham. ""We are confident that his achievements in the game and experience as a head coach will inspire our team and excite our fans and look forward to seeing the impact he will have on and off the field"". The South Florida club also expect to complete the signing of another of Martino's former charges at Barcelona, Spanish midfielder Sergio Busquets and Mas has indicated Miami could bring in as many as five players during the summer transfer window. Martino has been out of work since his contract with Mexico ended after a disappointing World Cup campaign where El Tri failed to get out of the group stage. ""I'm very excited to join a big club like Inter Miami and I know together we can accomplish many great things,"" said Martino. ""The club has the necessary infrastructure to be a major competitor in the region and I believe that with everyone's hard work and commitment we can get there,"" he said. Martino made his mark as a coach in Paraguay, leading the national side to the runners-up spot in the 2011 Copa America. After impressing at Newell's he had a season in charge of Barca in 2013-14 before taking over the Argentine national side for two years and then joined Atlanta in 2016. Martino will also be re-united with Venezuelan striker Josef Martinez whose 31 goals in 2018 were crucial to Atlanta's MLS Cup triumph. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A set of six jerseys that Lionel Messi wore during Argentina's victorious 2022 World Cup run will be auctioned in December, Sotheby's announced Monday, estimating their value at $10 million. The football star donned these shirts during the first halves of the group-stage rounds against Saudi Arabia and Mexico, as well as later games against Australia, the Netherlands and Croatia -- and the final against France. Argentina's winning run in Qatar last year was the final feather in the forward's cap, having failed to secure the championship in four previous World Cups. If the jerseys indeed fetch above $10 million, that could make the sale the most valuable collection of sports memorabilia ever auctioned off, Sotheby's said. The most expensive individual jersey ever sold at auction was one that basketball legend Michael Jordan wore during his NBA finals run with the Chicago Bulls in 1998. It sold for $10.1 million last year. Auction houses have increasingly taken note of sports memorabilia in recent years, considered a growing market. The shirts are being brought to auction by US tech startup AC Momento, which helps athletes manage memorabilia collections. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to the UNICAS Project, an initiative with a Barcelona children's hospital that helps kids with rare diseases. The jerseys will be available for free public viewing when they are up for auction, from November 30 to December 14. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Several players of India's I-League clubs have been approached to fix matches this season, the country's football federation said on Thursday. ""We have received information of multiple approaches to our players,"" All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey said in a statement. ""We will thoroughly examine the incidents, investigate, and take all necessary action."" The federation did not name players or clubs who had been approached to ""manipulate matches"" in the country's second tier competition featuring 13 clubs. Chaubey said the federation would further strengthen its system to counter such threats and educate players and officials on how to recognise such corrupt practices and report them. The AIFF set up its anti-corruption unit a decade ago after a Malaysian betting syndicate approached Indian players to fix I-League matches. It integrity officer Javed Siraj did not take calls by Reuters seeking details but a senior AIFF official, on condition of anonymity, called it a ""concern"". ""A few players reported similar approaches and results of a couple of matches raised our doubts,"" the official said. ""A clearer picture would emerge only after the investigation ends.""

"The BCB's anti-corruption unit has cleared the 2014-15 National Cricket League match between Rangpur Division and Dhaka Metropolis of match-fixing allegations, according to the tournament committee chairman Akram Khan. Khulna Division had laid these allegations in March. ""BCB's anti-corruption unit couldn't ascertain match-fixing in the Dhaka Metro-Rangpur match,"" Akram said. ""I have been told this verbally. We will issue letters to this effect in a day or two."" Khulna, Rangpur and Dhaka Division were all tied on 96 points ahead of the NCL's final round of matches. On the third day, Khulna completed an innings-and-24-run win over Chittagong Division which helped them move to 120 points. Rangpur then needed 25 points to move ahead of Khulna and to achieve that, Rangpur had to bowl out Dhaka Metropolis on the fourth and final day after setting them a 361-run-target with a minimum of 80 overs left in the day. Dhaka Metropolis were bowled out in the 80th over for 258. While this match was still going on, Khulna captain Abdur Razzak posted a status on Facebook alleging match-fixing in the NCL but didn't specify any team or player. He later deleted the post. The BCB formed a committee to probe the matter in May , with the board's new anti-corruption head Abu Mohammad Humayun Morshed doing the investigation. It followed a complaint on March 19 by Khulna officials to the BCB tournament committee. A recorded conversation between a Khulna official and a Dhaka Metropolis coach was also submitted. But Akram said that the contents of the audio clip couldn't be connected to the match in question, and hoped to move past the issue quickly, now that the allegations were found unproven. ""The audio clip couldn't really prove anything linked to the match. The match referee's report also didn't mention anything suspicious,"" he said. ""I shouldn't make a comment about the investigation's outcome.

During today’s BPL matches, the BCB will pay homage to Bangla language through various initiatives After restricting Chattogram to a par score of 132 for eight, Rangpur comfortably chased it down with four overs to spare, courtesy of the latest Aghan inclusion, Rahmanullah Gurbaz who made an instant impression in the tournament with a 30-ball 46 that featured seven fours and one six. Yet another low-scoring affair was on display in Mirpur as Khulna Tigers, having opted to bat first, managed to post a meagre 113 for eight. ","sports"
"Comilla Victorians defended the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) title in style, thanks to Johnson Charles' blistering unbeaten 52-ball 79, as they beat Sylhet Strikers by seven wickets in the final of the franchise-based T20 tournament tonight. Comilla, who have now won the BPL four times, chased down Sylhet's 175-run total with four deliveries to spare. Charles emerged as the hero for Comilla as the West Indian combined for stands of 70 and 72* with Liton Das and Moeen Ali for the third-wicket and fourth-wicket, respectively. The Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur staged a fascinating encounter overall, worthy of a grand finale. From the onset, the game kept swinging back and forth in the favour of both sides until the fourth last over of the game. Sent in to bat, Sylhet picked 18 runs in the first over but quickly lost in-form opener Towhid Hridoy for naught and their inspirational captain Mashrafe bin Mortaza (1), who again promoted himself up the order. It appeared Sylhet were struggling as scores read 48 for two after seven overs. Opener Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mushfqur Rahim broke the shackles from then on as Sylhet raced to hundred inside twelve overs, with Shanto bringing up his fifty in the process. Shanto got out at 64 eventually, but Mushfiqur (74) ensured Sylhet get to post a challenging total, 175 for seven after 20 overs, despite the veteran Bangladesh batter had kept losing partners at the other end. Chasing 176, Comilla openers Liton Das and Sunil Narine got more than the necessary momentum in the second over as the duo combined to score 20 runs off Tanzim Hasan Sakib. In the following over though, pacer Rubel Hossain gave Sylhet the key breakthrough of Narine, whose 23-ball 57 at the top was pivotal in handing Comilla winning the BPL last year. Skipper Imrul Kayes soon followed suit, removed by George Linde. The South African all-rounder went on to stifle the scoring rate, conceding only 11 runs in his first three overs. Liton then combined with Johnson Charles and the pair brought up Comilla's century after 12 overs, while Liton brought up his fifty off 36 deliveries. Liton's innings, however, perished right after, courtesy of a well-judged catch at the deep from Najmul Hossain Shanto after the stylish Bangladesh batter mistimed a pull shot off Rubel to become his second victim. And in came Moeen Ali and the English star immediately got going, striking consecutive boundaries through the cover off right-arm fast bowler Sakib, whose misery continued on the night. With 60 required off six overs with seven wickets in hand, Comilla had the advantage. In the end, Charles ripped apart the Sylhet bowlers and ended the game in a hurry with a flurry of sixes, while Moeen stayed not out on 25. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pat Cummins is unsure whether he will continue as Australia's one-day international captain after the World Cup but is looking to return to the Indian Premier League (IPL) next season in preparation for the Twenty20 showpiece. Test skipper Cummins, who will lead Australia into their semi-final against South Africa on Thursday, took on the ODI role with an eye firmly on the World Cup when Aaron Finch retired from the format last year. The paceman said he was ""potentially"" interested in staying on after the tournament but that the decision would rest with coach Andrew McDonald and head selector George Bailey's assessment of his workload and Australia's priorities. ""We've been pretty open, me and Andrew and George around different times in the year you're going to have different priorities,"" Cummins told reporters in Kolkata. ""After here, the focus shifts back to test cricket for a fair while. Probably like we've done in the past, at times white-ball cricket is going to have to shift so we fully focus on test cricket. So yeah, there's no end date in sight. ""I feel like I've been managed really well and looked after, albeit in a really, really busy year where you don't really want to give up any cricket."" The captaincy of the T20 side was vacated when Finch retired from all international cricket in February but Mitch Marsh is favourite to claim that role ahead of the World Cup in the Caribbean and U.S. next June. Cummins is keen to play a full part in that tournament, however, and signalled a return to the IPL next year after skipping it this year because of his busy schedule. ""I feel like I haven't played a heap of T20 cricket and in some ways I feel like I haven't played my best T20 cricket for a little while,"" Cummins added. ""I'm really excited, I'm probably going to go into the IPL auction for next year to try to get some games before that World Cup and push a case to not only make the side but get back to how I feel like I can bowl in T20 cricket."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A World Cup that started with questions over the future of 50-over one-day internationals ended with doubts still being expressed about their worth outside the context of a showpiece event. Australia's six-wicket win over India in front of a 92,000 crowd at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium may have been a disappointingly one-sided final for home and neutral fans. But the memory of several more dramatic contests earlier in the tournament was still vivid, with Afghanistan overwhelming defending champions England by 69 runs and non-Test nation the Netherlands defeating eventual semi-finalists South Africa. One of the plus points of an ODI is that it allows a team to stage the kind of epic comeback more often associated with a Test match, while still producing a result in a day. And while the high velocity, smash-and-grab Twenty20 game may be increasingly important to the finances of players and national boards alike, as evidenced by the lucrative Indian Premier League, it rarely produces drama to compete with cricket's longer formats. Nowhere was this more evident at this World Cup than during Australia's remarkable pool play victory over Afghanistan when, on the brink of defeat at 91-7 chasing 292, a staggering double century from Glenn Maxwell secured an extraordinary three-wicket win. Pat Cummins, who kept Maxwell company during an unbroken stand of 202 in that memorable match at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, admitted to mixed emotions after leading Australia to a record-extending sixth World Cup title. ""It's hard to say. Maybe because we won, but I did fall in love with ODI again this World Cup,"" said fast bowler Cummins, who took a superb 2-34 from his maximum 10 overs as Australia held India to a modest total of 240 all out. Australia briefly wobbled at 47-3 in reply before Travis Head's 137 and the opener's partnership of 192 with Marnus Labuschagne (58 not out) took Cummins's side to victory with seven overs to spare. ""I think the scenario where every game really matters, it does make it a bit different to just a bilateral (ODI),"" said Cummins after a win that ended a run of three straight World Cups titles for a host nation following 2011, 2015 and 2019 triumphs for India, Australia and England respectively. This was Australia's eighth appearance in a World Cup final, having been involved in the inaugural 1975 showpiece game, losing to the West Indies in a celebrated clash at Lord's. ""The World Cup's got such rich history, I'm sure it's going to be around for a long time,"" said the 30-year-old Cummins, with the next edition scheduled for 2027 in southern Africa. ""There's so many wonderful games, so many wonderful stories within this last couple of months. So, I think there's definitely a place (for it)."" But the issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""We believe strongly that ODIs should be World Cups only,"" he told ESPNcricinfo. ""They're not filling grounds in a lot of countries. And there is a power at the moment to T20 cricket that is almost supernatural."" He added, ""In a free market, the most money wins."" But former Hampshire captain Nicholas was a television broadcaster at a World Cup where he commentated admiringly on both Afghanistan and the Netherlands. And without bilateral ODIs between tournaments such as the World Cup and the Champions Trophy, to be next played in Pakistan in 2025, how will those teams maintain their standard or become even better at 50-over cricket? আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik criticised KL Rahul's approach in the final against Australia, saying that the batter played too many dot balls which led to India losing their early momentum. Rahul was India's top scorer in the final with 67 runs but it took the batter 107 balls to score those runs. Malik wasn't impressed by Rahul's efforts, saying that the in-form batter looked off colour in the final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. ""He [KL Rahul] has been taking a lot of responsibility when India lose quick wickets up front. If you will see his today's innings 66 off 107 balls, it was not a KL Rahul innings,"" Malik told A Sports on Sunday. ""He went into a zone, where he only wanted to play the whole fifty overs. He should have been a little more proactive,"" he added. Rahul found it difficult to rotate the strike and also couldn't hit boundaries to release the pressure. In his entire stay in the middle, Rahul could hit only one four, which came in the 27th over, which was also the first boundary in the match after 97 deliveries. Malik felt that Rahul should've been more proactive at the crease to make up for the dearth of boundaries. ""When you are batting on tough condition and you are not able to hit the boundaries, at least you rotate the strike. He played a lot of dots ball,"" said Malik. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh's cricket authorities said Monday they had compensated three senior cricketers a total of $65,000 for choosing to play for the national team rather than in the lucrative Indian Premier League this season. ""This is just a small gesture on our part,"" Bangladesh Cricket Board cricket operations chief Jalal Yunus told AFP, with the cash to be split three ways between Shakib Al Hasan, Taskin Ahmed and Liton Das. ""They did not demand any money from us formally, but we felt they should be at least partially compensated, if not fully"". Jalal said this would not be a regular practice. ""We believe playing for the national team should be unconditional,"" he added. ""But our board will consider it case-by-case, as players' well-being is also one of our priorities"". Shakib Al Hasan was picked up by the Kolkata Knight Riders for this year's IPL, but the all-rounder pulled out of the competition, which clashed with Bangladesh's series against Ireland at home and away. The BCB denied clearance to Test captain Shakib and vice-captain Liton until they played the one-off Test against Ireland in Dhaka from April 4 to 8. Liton, who got his maiden call-up in the IPL this season, also from the Knight Riders, joined the franchise after the Test match but returned home having played just one game. Taskin was unsold in the IPL players' auction, but Jalal said he had been offered a place as an injury replacement. Mustafizur Rahman was the only Bangladeshi player to have the opportunity to play for an extended stint with his IPL team this season, but ended up only appearing in two matches for the Delhi Capitals. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh team returned to the country on Sunday following their final World Cup game against Australia in Pune and the time for retrospection after the debacle has not been actively pursued by the board yet. Even at Mirpur's Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, there was no apparent activity apart from the humdrum in the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) offices yesterday, although few media personnel expected head coach Chandika Hathurusingha, who returned to the country with the team, to show up. It was learned that Hathurusingha will hand over a report regarding the World Cup debacle. Team director Khaled Mahmud will also be providing a separate report on the World Cup performances. BCB sources have said that the plans for the New Zealand series later this month are on the head coach's agenda at the moment. To oversee squad selection and build up to the series, Hathurusingha did not take a vacation this time around following a big tournament. Apart from the yet-to-be-submitted reports by the head coach and the team director, no other developments were confirmed and the BCB is yet to make any statements regarding what would be done to assess the World Cup performance or what moves would be taken following the disappointing results. The last round of the National Cricket League was slated to begin on November 16 but has been pushed back by two days to create time for the national team players to gear up for the tournament. ""All the players who will feature in the Test series will be playing the NCL,"" a BCB official confirmed to The Daily Star yesterday. It is expected that Hathurusingha will attend NCL matches. However, it could not be ascertained which games he will be attending personally. The last round's NCL matches will be part of the preparation for the Tests and the team would then return to training following a day's rest. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh players fell behind in most of the metrics in a torrid run in the recently concluded ICC World Cup but there was one aspect where they were right up there. With four successful Decision Review System (DRS) appeals out of 11 going their way (36.36 percent success rate), Bangladesh were only bettered by India when challenging the on-field umpire's decision. The 2023 World Cup runners-up got six of their DRS calls right, giving them a 40 percent success rate. Bangladesh batters had a tough time letting their willows flourish in the tournament but when it came to taking reviews, no side had more successful appeals -- where umpires had to overturn their decisions – than Bangladesh. The Tigers' batters were able to get three DRS reviews right out of the five appeals, giving them a 60 percent success rate followed by New Zealand batters, who had a success rate of 50 percent meaning they got three out of their six appeals right. However, Bangladesh languished at the bottom when it came to taking reviews as they challenged the umpire's call on 11 occasions, while South Africa topped that chart with a total of 23 reviews. The Proteas got only seven of those right and take the third spot with a success rate of 30.43. With a success rate of 30 percent, Sri Lanka placed fourth followed by New Zealand and Afghanistan, who jointly hold the fifth spot with a success rate of 27.78. Champions Australia could not get many right. In the 21 instances whey they opted for a review, they were able to get the umpire change his decision just four times, giving them the sixth spot with a success rate of 19.05. Pakistan and the Netherlands were the worst at judging which decisions to challenge as both sides got two DRS appeals right. Netherlands took a total of 21 reviews, while Pakistan went for 14. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Dinesh Karthik has been out of the Indian side for about two years now, but the wicketkeeper batsman is not losing sleep over it. ""See getting a place in the team is not up to me, so instead I do what I can and that is keeping up the hard work. But I am happy with the way my career has shaped up. I have had my fair share of ups and downs and that is a part and parcel of a sportsman and I have no regrets,"" Karthik said on the sidelines of a P&G Shiksha event where he was accompanied by wife Dipika Pallikal. Karthik, who is currently representing Abahani Limited in the Dhaka Premier Division League, says that he is enjoying the experience. ""I have played a match against Mohammedan Sporting and I was happy that the team won and I scored a century (109). I will be leaving on Friday to join the team again. I really enjoyed the match and I can't wait to go back again,"" he said. After MS Dhoni, it's Naman Ojha and Wriddhiman Saha who are ahead in the race while KL Rahul, too, had a good IPL as a keeper-batsman for Royal Challengers Bangalore. It can become a steep road ahead for Karthik, but for now he is looking to improve his game. ""I am not thinking too far ahead. I am keeping myself fit and playing as much as I can. It is more important to work on my skills and keep getting better. From the last IPL to this IPL, I can say that I have improved as a batsman,"" he said. Karthik played the IPL for Gujarat Lions this season and he said that it was initially difficult to gel as a unit. ""It was difficult for us in the beginning because we were an absolutely new franchise. It is tough because we were a bunch of boys who had never played together before. It was not easy but we bonded really fast and well. I think credit for that must go to coach Brad Hodge who saw to it that the team blends in well. The camaraderie off the field showed in the results too,"" he said, referring to the last-four finish. It was the brilliance of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers that stalled Gujarat Lions' progress in the IPL, and the keeper acknowledges that the Indian Test captain is playing a simply different level. ""When you speak about Virat, nothing is enough. I am really blown away by the way he is growing as a cricketer and a human being."" Karthik feels Kohli has set the benchmark very high for the others in the team. ""He has set the bar really high for the other cricketers. It will be right to say that he is in a different league and to be able to perform so consistently over a long period proves his class. It has been a pleasure to see him rise and rise above the rest,"" Karthik said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Abahani Limited led by Tamim Iqbal took Mushfiqur Rahim’s Mohammedan Sporting Club to school and thumped the Motijheel-based team by whopping 260-runs at BKSP today. Chasing 372 for victory, Mohammedan were never in contention after they were reduced to 6-92 inside 19 overs. Abahani bowlers were relentless and kept taking wickets at regular intervals. Shakib Al Hasan followed up his cameo with the bat with an imperious performance with the ball, and took his best bowling figures in List A cricket with five wickets for 18 runs in 6.3 overs. He polished off the Mohammedan lower order so his teammates could head for an early shower. Earlier, Abahani Limited amassed 371 for 5 in 50 overs riding on centuries from Liton Das and Dinesh Karthik respectively. Mohammedan skipper won the toss and opted to field first. The 3rd wicket stand of 162 runs in 25 overs, followed by the 4th wicket partnership of 101 runs in 8.4 overs took the game away from Mushy’s team. Liton notched up his highest score in List A cricket with 139 runs today. He faced 125 balls and smashed 18 fours and a huge six in his scintillating knock. Abahani’s Indian recruit Dinesh Karthik made merry on the flat track at BKSP, and muscled his way to 109 from 97 balls. He struck 11 fours and four sixes to the delight of his teammates. Shakib provided the finishing touch with his cameo of 54 from 24 balls. For Mohammedan, four bowlers were among the wickets, with Ariful Haque picking up two for 55 in his five overs. Thisara Perera, Naeem Islam and Enamul Haque jnr took a wicket each. Legends of Rupganj led by Asif Ahmed managed to overcome Victoria Sporting Club by two wickets at Fatullah today. The target of 259 runs was reached in 48.5 overs for the loss of eight wickets primarily because Rupganj’s Indian recruit Pawan Negi held one end secured with his unbeaten 124 from 89 balls. Negi smoked 13 fours and four sixes in his match-winning knock. Chaturanga de Silva was the best bowler on show for Victoria. He took five wickets for 46 runs in 9.5 overs. Victoria Sporting Club led by Nadif Chowdhury were invited to bat first by Legends of Rupganj skipper Asif Ahmed. 82 from Mominul Haque and Al-Amin’s 63 helped Victoria reach 258 in 50 overs. Mominul followed up his 73 against Gazi Group and 55 against Prime Bank with 82 from 72 balls today. He smashed eight fours and two sixes in his pacy innings. Al-Amin gave the impetus with 63 from 68 for Victoria. Taijul Islam was the most successful bowler for Rupganj, as he took 3-47 in nine overs. Abu Hider and Pawan Negi contributed with two scalps each. Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club v Prime Bank Cricket Club The rain affected match at Mirpur saw Prime Bank Cricket Club pip Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club by six wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis method. The revised target for Prime Bank was 118 from 33 overs. They reached their objective thanks to an unbeaten 43 from Unmukt Chand. He faced 61 deliveries and smashed three fours and two sixes to take his side home. The match between Prime Sporting Club and Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, Mirpur was stopped after 33 overs into Prime DSC’s innings due to rain. Prime DSC were asked to bat first, and were struggling at 6-83 inside 28 overs. When their score reached 100, the clouds broke free and the umpires decided to halt play. Nasir Hossain was batting at the crease with 30 to his name while Ziaur Rahman was not out at seven. Rubel Hossain took two wickets to rattle Prime DSC early. Shuvagata, Monir and Nazmul took a wicket each. Scores in brief Abahani Limited: 371 for 5 in 50 overs (Liton 139, Dinesh 109, Ariful 2-55) Mohammedan Sporting Club: 111 all out in 24.3 overs (Naeem 32, Musfiqur 26, Shakib 5-18) Result: Abahani Limited won by 260 runs Victoria Sporting Club: 258 all out in 50 overs (Mominul 82, Al-Amin 63, Taijul 3-47) Legends of Rupganj: 264 for 8 in 48.5 overs (Pawan 124, Mosharraf 41, Chaturanga 5-46) Result: Legends of Rupganj won by 2 wickets (with 7 balls remaining) Prime Doleshwar Sporting Club: 100/6 in 33 overs (Nasir 30*, Sunzamul 18, Rubel 2-19) Prime Bank Cricket Club: 122 for 4 in 25.0/33 overs, target 118 (Unmukt 43, Sabbir 28, Sunzamul 2-25) Result: Prime Bank Cricket Club won by 6 wickets (with 48 balls remaining) (D/L method) আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Dhaka Premier League's Super League round is set for two exciting encounters today. At the BKSP in Savar, Mushfiqur Rahim's Mohammedan will take on Tamim Iqbal's Abahani while league leaders Victoria Sporting Club will take on second-placed Legends of Rupganj, with just a point separating the two, at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah. The match at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur, when compared to the other two games, is expected to be a little less intense with Nasir Hossain's Prime Doleshwar taking on Sabbir Rahman's Prime Bank. It's a game that Prime Doleshwar are expected to win, going by the recent form of the sides. Although the face-off between the traditional heavyweights Abahani and Mohammedan always garners plenty of attention, the match between Victoria and Rupganj will be a lot more crucial as far as the championship is concerned. The last time these two teams met, Rupganj's Taijul Islam hit a six off the last delivery to dramatically tie the game. Ever since then, both sides have shown a balanced approach and it is therefore not a surprise that these two sides are leading the table at the moment. Victoria seem to be the favourites to win the game. Their batsmen Abdul Majed and Al-Amin have both been in divine touch. With 610 runs, Majed is currently the highest run-getter of the competition. And then there is the young Al-Amin, who has 530 runs but has a better batting average, 53. Al-Amin is quite a handful with the ball as well. His off-breaks earned him a five-wicket haul in the crucial game against Gazi Group Cricketers on June 9. And then there are the likes of Chaturanga de Silva, the highest wicket-taker of the competition, Mominul Haque and Nadif Chowdhury who provide further stability to the team. Rather than depending on individual players, Rupganj have played as a unit throughout the competition and that is the reason they have done well despite the fact that their top batsman, Soumya Sarkar, has not fired as yet. Their bowling front is led by Alauddin Babu, Abu Hider and Mosharraf Hossain. While both Alauddin and Abu have 13 wickets each, Mosharraf has 12. On the batting side, their hopes lie on Mohammad Mithun. They have not been doing too well with the bat, which is why they will need Soumya to hit form. He looked good in the last game when he scored a 40 against Prime Bank, but he needs to continue scoring in order to regain confidence. The last time Abahani and Mohammedan met, the latter, against the odds, beat a strong Abahani outfit. This time though, the scenario is the opposite. Abahani aced their last few games and seem to be doing well. Mohammedan on the other hand have not been able to find their rhythm. They were bundled out for just 128 in the last game against Rupganj. Prime Doleshwar will hope they can beat Prime Bank in Dhaka and put the BKSP blues behind them. Doleshwar were on the ascendency when the umpires decided to get off the field during their last game against Abahani. Nobody knows when that game will resume and it could lead to tense scenarios. And the best way to overcome that is to win. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Is there anybody in the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to better explain what is happening in the Dhaka Premier League? We are already on the verge of becoming a laughing stock after a series of questionable decisions involving umpires and a particular team. This is something we have been living for years when Bangladesh cricket was almost all about the Dhaka cricket league. The glamorous 50-over competition involving the top clubs, which has provided the backbone of what Bangladesh cricket is today, has never been short of controversy emanating from power struggles. Over the years we have seen matches being postponed at the drop of a hat, disgruntled fans chasing umpires out of the ground, not to mention the frequent incidents of crowd violence. A few may disagree, but the scenario of Dhaka cricket has significantly changed over the last few years with fans shifting their loyalty to the national team from their respective clubs. A few years ago a top-flight match guaranteed an almost full house. But now the crazed passion has subsided substantially with a few cricket fans turning up to the ground to enjoy a good game and more importantly watch their national heroes in action. While this change of attitude augurs well for Bangladesh's domestic cricket scenario, there are a few things that have refused to change. For instance, Abahani captain Tamim Iqbal barked like a greyhound at an umpire during his side's match against Prime Doleshwar at the BKSP on Sunday. But what happened after that the cricketing world has never witnessed before. The two on-field umpires apparently after failing to pacify Tamim, who was arguing for a stumping decision, walked off the field. The departure of the two men in uniform was quite interesting. The incident in question happened in the fourth ball of the 16th over of Doleshwar's innings. But they left the field after conducting the game for another eight deliveries amidst 'a barrage of verbal abuse' from the fielding side. The match referee later reported that the two umpires were 'too sick to conduct the game'. The drama continued. When many assumed that the match would resume on the reserve day on Monday, it was again put on hold with some wise words from the organisers Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolitan (CCDM): “We have got the match referee's report where it was written the umpires were sick and were unable to conduct the game. We were in doubt whether they (umpires) would be able to continue the game, that's why that match could not take place today [Monday]. We have asked the board to take a decision on this game. We have also communicated with other clubs that apart from this game other matches will go on as scheduled.” Now think of this game being played anywhere in a cricketing world where there is minimum respect for the laws of the game. First of all, Tamim would not have dared to be involved in such a fierce argument keeping in mind the fear of suspension. Let's forget about how sick the umpires are, officials are not supposed to leave the field unless there is a security issue. Besides, the game's law stipulates that if an umpire is sick, injured or incapable of conducting a game he will be replaced by another umpire to finish the game. And then the decision of the CCDM to put the game on hold and refer it to the apex body for a ruling is a dirty game that is not new to Bangladesh cricket. This whole episode is a clear case of flaunting the laws of a game in every way possible. It is not a case of blaming Tamim or the two umpires. It's an issue of whether the custodians of the game have the desire and respect to implement the laws as they are meant and duty-bound to do. Recent events show they are clearly not interested. Shame on the CCDM! Shame on BCB. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The match between Northern Warriors and Chennai Braves in the Abu Dhabi T10 League on Saturday was witness to a bizzare and suspicious looking front-foot no ball, sparking speculation among fans on social media. The incident happened in the fifth over of the second innings. In the third ball of the over, Warriors' Indian pacer Abhimanyu Mithun overstepped the bowling crease by almost two feet. The clipping of the delivery is making rounds on social media, with fans stunned and making speculations about the no-ball. Abhimanyu, who has played four Tests and five ODIs for India, was the pick of the bowlers from his side in the match, conceding just 11 runs in his two overs while claiming a couple of wickets. However, he couldn't save his team from a five-run defeat. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh T20I and Test captain Shakib Al Hasan hopes for a new champion outside of India-Pakistan-Sri Lanka in the upcoming Asia Cup, a tournament where the Bangladesh team have played three finals in the last four editions. Shakib went to attend the 'Icon Unveiling' ceremony of Bangla Tigers – a franchise team of the Abu Dhabi T10 League -- in Dubai yesterday ahead of Bangladesh team's practice for the Asia Cup in the same city. The star all-rounder will be seen playing in the 10-over cricket tournament as an Icon Player for the Bangla Tigers, who have chosen former India cricketer Shanthakumaran Sreesant as their brand ambassador. Shakib had previously played for Kerala Kings in the league's inaugural season in 2017. ""Proud to be part of Bangla Tigers. When offered to play, I figured there was an opportunity and I had no option but to accept. Having been third in the previous season, I would like to see Bangla Tigers becoming the champions this time, obviously,"" Shakib said. During the event, the topic of the Asia Cup understandably came up. Shakib hopes a new team will get to taste the glory. ""Like I've said before, it would be nice to get a new champion team, which is especially possible in a format like the T20,"" said the Bangladesh captain.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Mushfiqur Rahim made 26 off 32 balls in a crucial match against Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League at BKSP yesterday and thus he could not even contribute enough for Mohammedan to at least avoid the embarrassing 260-run defeat. Interestingly, the 29-year old wicketkeeper-batsman left the captaincy to concentrate more on his batting. Many eyebrows were raised when Naeem Islam went for the toss in the morning against the Tamim Iqbal-led Abahani and later the Mohammedan officials confirmed that Mushfiqur wanted relief from the pressure of captaincy to concentrate on his batting. This is not the first time that Mushfiqur, who so far scored 480 runs in 13 matches at the average of 48.00 with one hundred and four fifties in the ongoing league, gave up captaincy. In December last year Mushfiqur resigned as captain of the Sylhet Super Stars in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) ahead of the team's clash against Barisal Bulls while in 2013, he quit the Bangladesh captaincy after they lost the ODI series against Zimbabwe but was later convinced by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to continue in the role. So, this obviously begs the question of how it will be possible for one of the country's finest batsmen to lead the Tigers in Test cricket, arguably the most high-pressure environment in the international game. BCB split the national team's captaincy duties in late 2014, giving the ODI and T20I job to Mashrafe Bin Mortaza to relieve Mushfiqur from additional pressure. The decision understandably could not satisfy the little man. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Faf du Plessis and Glenn Maxwell smashed another big partnership and Harshal Patel held his nerve as Royal Challengers Bangalore beat Rajasthan Royals in a big-scoring IPL thriller on Sunday. Trent Boult trapped Virat Kohli leg-before first ball for his 100th wicket and the Kiwi quick had Bangalore reeling on 12-2 with the scalp of Shahbaz Ahmed inside an electric M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. But du Plessis -- the top-scorer of the current Indian Premier League edition -- and Maxwell soon got Bangalore out of trouble and ended up hammering 127 runs off only 66 balls. Maxwell led the way with 77 off 44 while du Plessis hit 62 off 39 balls before being run out for 62. Maxwell switch-hit Ravichandran Ashwin straight to Jason Holder at backward point for 77. Dinesh Karthik again failed to impress at the death, making just 16 off 13 and Bangalore ended with a total of 189-9 that gave table-topping Rajasthan more than a glimmer of hope of victory. But the pink brigade's Jos Buttler became the second star batter to depart for a duck, cleaned up by a jubilant Mohammed Siraj on the England captain's second ball. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Devdutt Padikkal then added 98 runs for the second wicket but they fell in the space of 12 deliveries, with Harshal getting Jaiswal for 47 and David Willey the wicket of Padikkal for 52. Sanju Samson managed only 22, while Shimron Hetmyer was run out cheaply for three. Dhruv Jurel smacked 34 not out off 16 balls, while Ashwin threw his bat around to bring the game down to the last over. But despite scoring 10 off three balls Ashwin was caught for 12 going for a big heave to give Harshal his third wicket of the game and Bangalore a seven-run victory. ""It is about momentum at this ground,"" said losing skipper Samson. ""Normally, Hetmyer does it for us, but he had an off game. We have now lost two games in a row.

"All the stats as Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell clubbed a stunning double hundred that shattered records and steered the five-time champions to victory over Afghanistan at the ICC World Cup 2023. Glenn Maxwell amassed an unbelievable double century to lift Australia out of the abyss against Afghanistan in Mumbai. Australia were reeling at 91-7 in a run-chase of 292, when Maxwell joined hands with Pat Cummins to put on a 202-run partnership where the skipper had to contribute only 12. The duo remained unbeaten as Australia reached their target and secured a place in the knockout stages of the Cricket World Cup, while Maxwell smashed multiple records in an all-time incredible innings. 1. First non-opener to make a double hundred in an ODI Maxwell became the first non-opener in men's ODIs to make a double hundred. There have now been 11 men's ODI double hundreds but before Maxwell's outstanding knock each of them had been compiled by an opener, while the Australia all-rounder came in at No.6 to add even more gloss to an incredible feat. 2. Highest individual score for Australia in an ODI Maxwell became the first batter from Australia to score a men's ODI double hundred while beating the side's previous top score in the format of Shane Watson's 185* against Bangladesh in 2011. Belinda Clark is the only other Australia batter to score an ODI double hundred when the former captain smashed 229* against Denmark in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup in 1997. 3. Highest individual score in an ODI run-chase Maxwell's score of 201* is the highest by any batter in the second innings of an ODI and the first double hundred in the format when chasing. The previous highest score in a run chase came from Fakhar Zaman with 193 against South Africa in Johannesburg in 2021. 4. Third double hundred in men's Cricket World Cups Maxwell's sensational knock is only the third double century to come in a men's Cricket World Cup. Martin Guptill (237*) against West Indies and Chris Gayle (215) against Zimbabwe - both in 2015 - are the only other batters to hit the mark in the men's tournaments. 5. Second-fastest double hundred in an ODI Maxwell hit the fastest double hundred in a men's Cricket World Cup match, and the second-fastest in all ODIs. The Australia dynamo missed Ishan Kishan's ODI record by a whisker, taking 128 balls to reach his double century which was just two more than the 126 balls the India wicket-keeper batter needed last year against Bangladesh. 6. Highest partnership for seventh wicket or lower in a men's ODI The Maxwell-Cummins partnership rescued Australia with the a 202-run stand that is now the highest for the seventh wicket or lower in a men's ODI. The record was previously held by England pair Jos Buttler and Adil Rashid for a 177-run stand for the seventh wicket against New Zealand in 2015. The 202 runs that Maxwell and Cummins compiled is also the most that a team has put together after the fall of their seventh wicket in a men's ODI. 7. Highest successful run chase for Australia in men's Cricket World Cups Maxwell and Cummins steered Australia to their target of 292 against Afghanistan which is now the five-time champions' highest successful chase in men's Cricket World Cups. Australia's previous highest successful run chase was 287 against New Zealand in the quarter-final of the 1996 tournament. 8. Most hundreds when batting at No.5 or lower at Cricket World Cups Maxwell now has three hundreds at Cricket World Cups while coming in to bat at No.5 or lower. No other batter has more than one century from batting at No.5 or below. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman might not be as mysterious as he was at the beginning of his career but the left-arm paceman managed to achieve a feat he can be happy about against India in Colombo yesterday. Mustafizur became the fastest Bangladeshi to 150 ODI wickets when he scalped the wicket of Shardul Thakur during a crucial penultimate over. With that wicket, he reached the 150-wicket mark in ODIs in 91 matches, eclipsing the previous Bangladesh best by former left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who had reached 150 ODI wickets in his 108th game in 2004. The record for the fastest 150 ODI wickets, however, remains to Australia's Mitchell Starc. The Aussie quick reached the feat in just 77 matches. After claiming the landmark wicket, Mustafizur was hit for a boundary by Axar Patel but went on to dismiss the batter in the very next delivery when he mistimed another one of Mustafizur's cutters and was caught by a running fielder at long-off. Mustafizur gave away just five runs and picked up two crucial wickets in the 49th over, all but ensuring the victory for the Tigers. The left-arm pacer ended with match figures of three for 50 in eight overs and now has a total of 151 ODI wickets. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood on Friday said their bowlers have made specific plans to keep the Bangladesh batsmen ""under pressure"" in their Super Four clash of the Asia Cup. Bangladesh's batting faltered in two of the three matches of the 50-over tournament, a precursor to the upcoming ODI World Cup in India. The Bangla Tigers take on Sri Lanka in Colombo on Saturday in a must-win match to keep their hopes high of reaching the final, after they lost their Super Four opener to Pakistan. Shakib Al Hasan's team were bowled for 194 against Pakistan in Lahore, but their bowlers led by Taskin Ahmed fought to get three Pakistan wickets. ""I have been very impressed with them, particularly their pace bowlers. They are strong, accurate and get movement,"" Silverwood said of the Bangladesh quicks. ""From the Bangladesh batting perspective, we have to make sure to keep them under pressure. We know they haven't got runs, but we know what they are capable of getting -- and give them that respect. Try and apply the pressure and get the wickets."" Silverwood added: ""We analyse each batsman and each bowler makes different plans for each batsman."" Sri Lanka survived a big scare by Afghanistan before they sneaked into the Super Fours with a narrow win which witnessed a miscalculation drama. Afghanistan believed they needed to chase down their target of 292 in 37.1 overs to lift their net run-rate, but the analysts pointed to different numbers when they neared the target. Silverwood said it remains a ""watershed moment"" for all the teams to take a lesson to view run-rates and calculations. Bangladesh coach Chandika Hathurusingha remains confident about his team's chances in the next two matches. ""We have to play in different conditions from the past two games against different opposition, so it's a big challenge for us,"" said Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lankan all-rounder. ""But we are much more capable of what we have shown. The inconsistency is the one that we have to address and look forward to put on a good show."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Sri Lanka's crushing 10-wicket loss to India in the Asia Cup final should help the team learn lessons for the ODI World Cup, coach Chris Silverwood said Sunday. The home team were bowled out for just 50 in 15.2 overs with Indian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj ripping through the batting with his 6-21 in Colombo. Sri Lanka were playing their 11th Asia Cup final but the 116-minute humilation left the fans disappointed and coach Silverwood said he hoped it will be a blessing in disguise. ""Sometimes a bit of a kick up the rear end is not the worst thing going into a World Cup,"" Silverwood told reporters. ""Maybe this is just a wake up call, that for us to compete against teams like India, Australia, and New Zealand - those types of guys - we have to be on top of our game. He said, ""Maybe there's something we can use out of this that can motivate us heading into that World Cup."" Sri Lanka, who have made the ODI World Cup starting October 5 in India after playing the qualifiers, went in as underdogs in the regional 50-over tournament. But what unfolded in the final was unexpected as Dasun Shanaka's Sri Lanka fell like a pack of cards after they elected to bat first. ""Clearly it was a bad day in the office. Clearly we came up against a very high-class bowling unit,"" said Silverwood. ""It was a shame to finish the way we did. It's one of those things we can't dwell on too much because we've got a big tournament coming up. There are lessons to learn and questions to be asked in the dressing room."" Sri Lanka overcame an inconsistent showing at the start of the tournament and sneaked into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. Fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage stood out for Sri Lanka with 21 wickets between them and Silverwood counted them as positives from the tournament. ""We played some very good cricket to get to the final. We had to fight very hard. For me it was an achievement,"" said Silverwood. ""But if we take today out of the equation, we've seen two youngsters put their hands up, in Dunith Wellalage, and Matheesha Pathirana. We've seen two of them really put up their hands on the world stage."" He added, ""Sadeera (Samarawickrama) played some good knocks. (Kusal) Mendis has come back into form. But clearly consistency is something we need to bring into the game.""

"New Zealand captain Kane Williamson has been ruled out of the team's immediate World Cup matches with a fractured thumb, but head coach Gary Stead is optimistic the batter will be back in action at some stage of the tournament. After spending nearly seven months on the sidelines with a knee injury, Williamson made 78 not out in his return to action in the team's comprehensive victory against Bangladesh on Friday. The 33-year-old, however, was struck by a throw while running between the wickets during the match, which now makes him uncertain for the tournament. Tom Blundell will travel to India as cover, but Williamson will remain with the team with the hope of being available for the back end of group play next month, New Zealand Cricket said in a statement on Saturday. ""Firstly, we're all feeling for Kane to have this occur after all his hard work to return from his knee injury,"" Stead said. ""While it's disappointing news, the initial diagnosis has given us some optimism he can still feature later in the pool play following a period of rest and rehabilitation. ""Kane is clearly a massive part of our side and a world class player and captain - so we'll look to give him every opportunity we can to return in the tournament."" Blundell was picked ahead of Henry Nicholls, who suffered a mild side-strain during a Plunket Shield warm-up match the week. ""Tom's been with the one-day side on tours to Pakistan and Bangladesh and performed well,"" Stead said. ""He covers multiple positions in the batting order and his wicket-keeping skills are also an added bonus as a back-up.""

"A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday.

Its Hotstar streaming app set a concurrent viewership record of 59 million during the final match of the World Cup, the company said in a statement. The numbers offer some relief for the Burbank-headquartered entertainment giant's India unit, which is exploring options of finding a joint venture partner or selling its business.

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director Akram Khan feels that the 'battle of words' right before the World Cup was the main reason behind the team's abysmal performance in the showpiece event in India. ""The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That's why we as a nation didn't perform well,"" Akram told the media in Mirpur today. ""The players need to go and perform on the field. We couldn't do that. We were busy talking about off the field topics. Everyone needs to realise that,"" he added. The Tigers had a disappointing showing in the World Cup in India, losing seven out of their nine matches to finish eighth in the 10-team competition. The Bangladesh team went through a change in captaincy a little over a month before the World Cup when Tamim Iqbal stepped down and Shakib Al Hasan stepped up as the skipper. The drama only increased when Tamim got axed from the World Cup squad for being unfit. The opener refuted that claim in a video posted on social media, which was then countered by Shakib in a pre-recorded interview, where he labelled Tamim's action as 'childish'. The chaos in the buildup evidently didn't help the team's cause in the World Cup. Without naming anyone in particular, Akram said that clashes between individuals handicapped Bangladesh in the tournament. ""This country belongs to all of us. If Bangladesh do well, all of us will feel happy. But if some people only do things as they wish, then this will not happen. ""I've always noticed that during major tournaments we talk too much about things which aren't related to the game. That puts everyone under pressure. He was also critical of the experiments made to the squad by the team management in the matches leading up to the World Cup. ""I had said this before, the Asia Cup could've been the ideal tournament for the players who will take part in the World Cup. But we experimented with the team in that tournament and eventually couldn't form a stable unit.

"Following ICC World Cup debacle, the spotlight shifts to Test cricket for Bangladesh as they kick off the third cycle of the World Test Championship (WTC) with a two-match Test series against New Zealand, beginning November 28 in Sylhet. Bangladesh dwelled at the bottom of the table in the two WTC cycles that preceded, and it appears the Tigers are likely to encounter significant obstacles in the coming season as well -- for they have to host South Africa and Sri Lanka and travel to India, Pakistan and West Indies, with the latter tour could likely be the least difficult assignment. Without some proven members and on the back of a last-moment change in captaincy, handed to 25-year-old Najmul Hossain Shanto, the hosts may not enjoy the home advantage against the Kiwis, according to esteemed coach Nazmul Abedeen Fahim. ""It's not that we weren't doing well in the past, but the stability that we had in the past is no longer there. We had been unable to prepare new players, and existing ones are currently unavailable. So, it'll be challenging and frightening,"" Fahim told The Daily Star yesterday. ""Look, the New Zealand spinners are better than us. Moreover, they're coming prepared in terms of batting and they're strong in both the spin and pace departments, so we don't have the home advantage. ""Things are going against us, so it's unlikely that we'll suddenly start faring well in Test cricket, but what we can do now is revamp the domestic circuit's longer formats."" A momentous triumph against New Zealand in Mount Maunganui, led by Mominul Haque, in the preceding WTC cycle was billed as a watershed moment in Bangladesh's Test cricket, but things did not unfold as planned due to a lack of long-term planning. While creating good wickets at home has emerged as the need of the hour, however, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has also been unable to focus on improving competitiveness in domestic events, which has impacted the mentality of the cricketers. The veteran coach continued, ""Obviously, preparing a good wicket is a factor. But if we talk about team selection, management, umpiring, overall supervision, monitoring and, most importantly, the competitiveness factor, it's absent. ""Our first-class matches are similar to trial matches in that the players go out with the expectation that if they score runs or pick wickets, they will be selected for the national team. When players perform for the national team, they aim to win matches for the team, and this should be the case in domestic cricket as well, but it isn't."" ""At times, even if you play for the team and bowl economically but remain wicketless, that player may feel he will not be noticed, so you start thinking about your personal interests rather than the team's interests. So, the lack of emotional attachment keeps the gap between domestic and international cricket wide open,"" he explained. It will be critical for the relevant authorities to set in motion a long-term plan and have the guts to accept failure to begin with, or else the board's typical hand-to-mouth approach would only keep stunting the growth of the country's most followed sport. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Less than a month since a disappointing campaign in India at the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023, England skipper Jos Buttler will lead a fresh-looking ODI side in the West Indies. England booked a place at the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy by a whisker after finishing seventh at the Cricket World Cup last month. Heading into the Caribbean, Buttler is keen to put the 'one bad tournament' behind and maintained that the white-ball squad was in a good place. ""We have had one bad tournament,"" Buttler said ahead of the first ODI in Antigua. ""It's been in a great place for a long time and you see the depth of talent of guys coming through and you want to help shape that period of white-ball cricket. That's something I feel responsibility and motivation for - to get England white-ball cricket back to where it's been for a long time."" Buttler also stressed that it was a learning curve for him to focus on his own performances as well as the team's when leading the side. ""That's a big learning for me, managing my own game is vital to the team and just finding different ways to do that to allow me to walk to the middle with a clear mind.  ""[And] realising that sort of tournament doesn't define you. I've got to use it as motivation and hunger to push myself and the team forward and take the learnings from that. Use it as a positive experience to go into the rest of my career."" The England skipper went on to state that at this point in his career, with a young family around him, he has better perspective and maturity in dealing with disappointments on the field. ""I'm at the stage of my life and career where I have got good perspective. I get home and have got two children who don't really care about the World Cup. It certainly gives you a nice focus as a dad and those things, but I'm a very proud guy as well and have disappointments. ""But you know, life moves on, the world moves on pretty fast.

""There's some really exciting talent in this team,"" Butter said. ""Young guys eager to get their opportunities and perform. There's some guys that have not been exposed to ODI cricket a lot, but have a lot of experience in Test cricket, so not necessarily new to the international game. It's a nice blend."" Two of those new guys, Phil Salt and Will Jacks, were confirmed as openers for the first ODI by Buttler with no details shared on the composition of the bowling attack.

"Azmatullah Omarzai scored a battling half-century, yet Afghanistan were bowled out for 126 runs in 45.2 overs in the third ODI in Chattogram on Tuesday. The Afghan all-rounder scored 56 off 71 deliveries, but the Afghans failed to avoid being bowled out for their lowest total in ODIs against the Tigers, thanks to a terrific spell from Bangladesh pacer Shoriful Islam. The previous lowest total for Afghanistan against Bangladesh was when they were bundled out for 138 in Mirpur in 2016. Having lost the first two matches comprehensively, the Tigers made three changes to the playing XI while Afghanistan made two changes, including giving a rest to their premier leg-spinner Rashid Khan. Afghanistan won the toss and opted to bat, but they were in trouble early on with Shoriful Islam spewing fire. The left-arm quick took the first two wickets in his second over and the visitors, who were looking for a first whitewash of the Tigers, never recovered. Shoriful, who was in for Mustafizur Rahman as part of three changes in the bowling department, finished with figures of 4-21 as Bangladesh had complete control over the Afghan batters all through the innings. Taskin Ahmed and Taijul Islam took two wickets each while Shakib Al Hasan and Mehedi Hasan Miraz took a wicket apiece for the hosts. With the wicket of Nazibullah Zadran, Shakib (305 wickets) also moved to the second spot alongside New Zealand's Daniel Vettori in the list of left-arm spinners for most ODI wickets. Bangladesh are looking to avoid their first home whitewash in the format since 2014. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan today said that his team's main focus in the upcoming ICC World Cup would be to show the world how good they are in the 50-over format. Shakib talked about his World Cup goal and ODI captaincy for the first time since returning as Bangladesh's ODI following the resignation of Tamim Iqbal. ""Well, it's nothing new to me,"" Shakib said regarding his ODI captaincy in an interview during the Lanka Premier League match between Galle Titans and Jaffna Kings at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo today. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), on August 11, named Shakib as Bangladesh ODI captain to lead in the upcoming Asia Cup and the World Cup. The Asia Cup will be held in August-September in Pakistan and Sri Lanka while the World Cup will be held in India in November-December. This will be the second stint as ODI captain for Shakib, who had previously led Bangladesh in 50 ODIs between 2009 and 2017. The all-rounder also currently leads the Tigers in Tests and T20Is. When asked about his target in the upcoming World Cup, Shakib said: ""It's a great challenge for our team to showcase how good we have become in the last four years. It will be a great opportunity for us to do well in the World Cup."" ""We are a very good team and we are playing really very well in the white-ball format, so now it's time to show everyone how good we are,"" Shakib added. Shakib bowled a miserly spell of one for 13 and scored two runs as his side thrashed Jaffna Kings by seven wickets in the match.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said his team are enjoying the victory, but knows that there would be criticism of his side if they do poorly in the next match. The 25-year-old, led Bangladesh to a first-ever home Test win against New Zealand in Sylhet on Saturday in what was his first assignment as the skipper in the red-ball format, said his and his team's focus is on 'maintaining the process and giving full commitment on the field ""Overall we played a very good match. I'm very happy to have won the first Test match as a captain,"" Shanto told reporters at the post-match press conference in Sylhet. ""We had the belief that we could win this match. I said that before the Test because I believed we could win. I think the belief was within everyone. ""The job is only half-done. Another match is left and it's not as if we will go there and win it too. We'll have to work for five more days for that victory."" Shanto has had opportunities in the past to captain in shorter formats but this was his first assignment in a Test match where his team were thought of as underdogs due to the absence of important players such as Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Taskin Ahmed and Ebadot Hossain. But Bangladesh dominated the former World Test Championship winners from in all departments and eventually won the match by 150 runs. Shanto feels there will be more expectation the next time around, especially as they travel to Dhaka for the second Test starting from December 6. ""I'm not too concerned about winning or losing. I feel if the process is maintained and if the commitment is there from the players, I'm fine. If those things are there, results will likely come out positive. ""There will be outside talk. Now [that we won], there will be a lot of good words said about us and then there will be criticism if we do poorly in another match. That is not in our control and we don't think about that either,"" said Shanto, who apart from showing excellent captaincy skills, scored a fine century in the second innings of the match. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The fact that there is a dearth of players, especially off-spinners, in Bangladesh's pipeline was made even more apparent following the Tigers' recent debacle against Sri Lanka in the two-match Test series at home last month. The root cause for the issue could be drawn back to the mediocre domestic standard of Bangladesh cricket. Even veteran cricket coach Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, mentor to many stalwarts of Bangladesh, had said that the low standard of Bangladesh's domestic cricket stands in the way of players preparing for the international stage. And hence, even though there remains a number of performers at the domestic level, the national selectors often find themselves in a spot of bother in naming replacements for any player on the national side. Echoing similar statements as Fahim, domestic spin coach Sohel Islam also pointed toward the difference in standards between the domestic and international levels as the main reason behind Bangladesh's issues with having adequate players in the pipeline. ""It takes time to create a pipeline. We all know that there is a difference in standard between our domestic cricket and international cricket,"" said Sohel, who was overseeing the spinners during the national team's practice in Mirpur today. Sohel also mentioned that there remains no scope for snap judgment if the pipeline is to be enriched. ""Now, when we take a talented player from the pipeline to the international stage, we must ensure he gets enough time at the international level. If we bring a player to the international stage and judge him after just a match or two….the thing is players like [Mehedi Hasan] Miraz, Taijul [Islam] or Nayeem [Hasan] were not created overnight. The up-and-coming players should be given time,"" Sohel added. During the recently-concluded Sri Lanka series, Bangladesh included Mosaddek Hossain as a replacement for Nayeem Hasan after the latter was ruled out of the second Test due to an injury. The main reason behind including, and playing, Mosaddek a Test after more than two years was that the team management was unable to find another like-for-like off-spinner in place of Nayeem. According to Sohel, Bangladesh do have off-spinners but they would need proper grooming and given enough time to flourish. ""I won't say that we do not have off-spinners. We have but we need to nurse them. They need to be kept as backup players in the national set-up and they would need practice in that set-up. If such an environment can't be created for them or of they are not played in such [international standard] matches then it becomes very difficult to have players ready for this stage,"" Sohel concluded. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"We've been here before. A World Cup looming, fans desperately trying to gauge how Bangladesh will perform in the showpiece event. You reach a consensus, perhaps to the tune of ""they will get blown away this year"" or, at the other end of the spectrum, ""they're playing well, they might just conjure something"". And then the Tigers do the opposite. Consider the track record. Leading up to the country's first World Cup appearance in England in 1999, the Tigers played the Asia Cup and a few international triangulars. Against the big boys, a score of 180 not all out was creditable, and Bangladesh struggled to beat Kenya. The stage was set for a hammering in the World Cup played in the unfamiliar conditions of England and Wales, right?  Wrong. Bangladesh beat Scotland, a fellow minnow, and Pakistan, the eventual runners-up and till that shock result against Bangladesh, the form team of the tournament. Come South Africa 2003, Bangladesh were drawn in a group with Canada and Kenya. Having been elevated to Test status three years earlier, Bangladesh were part of cricket's big-boy table and those other teams were not. So, at least one confirmed win, given what they did in the last World Cup? Wrong again -- losses to everyone bar West Indies, as that match was rained out. Their worst performance in the tournament history. In the next global showpiece in the West Indies, they were drawn with India, Sri Lanka and Bermuda in a group from which two would progress. No chance? Think again. In a tournament-altering result, the Tigers knocked India out and then beat South Africa in the Super Eights, before doing the decent thing and not making it to the semifinals.  This pattern goes on. At home in 2011, with a buildup that consisted of beating New Zealand 4-0 and a rising trend in performance in home matches, you could have been forgiven for being in the ""might just conjure something"" camp. Fifty-eight all out against the West Indies, 78 all out against South Africa, and as one of the host nations, Bangladesh could not finish even in the top eight. Not even close. Fast forward to 2015 in Australia. The previous year was among the worst in Bangladesh's history, with the Tigers losing anything that could be lost, and then coming up with ways to lose matches that seemed impossible not to win (having Sri Lanka 67 for eight, then losing by 13 runs in Mirpur, for a dire example). But then they went on to play the quarterfinals in Australia, with Rubel Hossain's memorable demolition of England and Mahmudullah Riyad's consecutive tons against England and New Zealand the standout memories.  Let's waste the least amount of space recounting the latest, as it is freshest. One of the fastest improving teams under Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, the Tigers won their maiden multi-team trophy on the eve of the 2019 World Cup, but then finished eighth out of 10 teams when it mattered. This time, even neutrals were giving them a fair chance of making a deep run. With the above summary of World Cups past, you may find a pattern, that they seem to shine in alternate World Cups, or that they can reliably be expected to do the opposite of what is expected. But the wider picture, the wider pattern, is of chaos and inconsistency. Things have been glossed over in the aforementioned retrospective. In 2007, they KO'd India and South Africa, but in the other outings were comprehensively outplayed, even by their 2007 standards.  In 2011, apart from the abject displays against the West Indies and South Africa, there was hope for a while with victories over the Netherlands, Ireland and a particularly rousing and exciting one over England. Memories of 2015 glories must be tempered by the fact that a quarterfinal finish, in all likelihood, was made possible by a fortunate washout against hosts and eventual champions Australia. And lastly, in 2019 before the gloomy end in Lord's came the brightest of beginnings at The Oval, when Bangladesh beat South Africa, then almost defeated eventual finalists New Zealand, and then pulled off a successful 300-plus chase over the West Indies in Taunton. So, what is the expectation for India 2023? Why are we even asking? What could possibly be the answer? We could say that Bangladesh were as high as third in the 2023 World Cup race, but then we'd have to say they are seventh in the current ODI rankings. We could say that under Tamim Iqbal a relatively stable team had been improving since the last World Cup, but after that thing that happened when he retired, unretired and then quit captaincy, stability is not the word.  We could say that they won series against South Africa away from home and India at home, but then they lost to Afghanistan at home, and were unable to bat even 40 overs on an absolute belter of a pitch against Pakistan in the recently concluded Asia Cup. The simplest thing, and closest to the truth, to say is that we do not know. The BCB does not know, the players do not know, neither do sports writers or fans. We do not know what surprises the World Cup squad will hold. It will probably be announced a minute before players are asked to leave for the airport. Will it affect them? Not likely. By now they have probably figured out the only reliable pattern, that there will be chaos. We should too, and embrace it. At least, going by past tournaments, it won't be boring.

"The World Cup semifinal between India and New Zealand in Mumbai on Wednesday was being played on a used pitch, sparking concerns the tournament hosts had tried to manipulate conditions in their favour. Both Britain's Daily Mail and the ESPNCricinfo website reported the match was initially supposed to be played on pitch seven, the central strip at the Wankhede Stadium, a surface unused in the group stages. However, the game was switched to pitch six, the surface used for South Africa's 229-run win over England on October 21, and India's 302-run victory over Sri Lanka on November 2. According to the International Cricket Council's tournament playing conditions, the relevant ground authority -- in this case the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) - ""is responsible for the selection and preparation of the pitch"" before any given match"". The Mail claimed the ICC's independent pitch consultant Andy Atkinson was frustrated by changes to pre-tournament plans. They quoted a leaked email in which he speculated whether the pitch for Sunday's final in Ahmedabad ""will be the first ever ICC CWC final to have a pitch which has been specifically chosen and prepared to their stipulation at the request of the team management and/or the hierarchy of the home nation board"". New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, speaking after India skipper Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bat on Wednesday, said: ""It's obviously a used surface but we'll try to make use of it with the ball first up and hopefully there's some dew later."" Used pitches generally aid spinners. The semifinals of the 2019 World Cup in England were played on fresh pitches, but used strips were provided for the semifinals of last year's T20 World Cup in Australia. On Wednesday, the ICC insisted there was nothing untoward with the change in pitch at the Wankhede. ""Changes to planned pitch rotations are common towards the end of an event of this length, and has already happened a couple of times,"" said a spokesperson. ""This change was made on the recommendation of the venue curator in conjunction with our host. ""The ICC independent pitch consultant was apprised of the change and has no reason to believe the pitch won't play well."" The winners of Wednesday's match will face either Australia or South Africa, who play in Kolkata on Thursday, in the final. Australia captain Pat Cummins said Wednesday he had confidence in the integrity of the ICC's pitch process. ""Yeah, I saw that (the report)...obviously ICC have an independent pitch curator who manages that so I'm sure they are all over making sure it's fair for both teams,"" Cummins said.

"Pakistan's batting hero Mohammad Rizwan said his team was confident of achieving a World Cup record chase against Sri Lanka in Hyderabad, clinching Tuesday's match by six wickets. Rizwan scored 131 not out and in the company of opener Abdullah Shafique (113) set the platform for chasing a daunting 345-run target with 10 balls to spare. Rizwan said belief was the key. ""We had the belief to chase that down,"" said Rizwan of Pakistan's chase which beat the previous record of 328 by Ireland against England in Bangalore in 2011. Rizwan praised Shafique's knock and his partnership of 176 runs for the third wicket. ""Shafique played very well and when there is a 345-run target on the board then as opener you have a burden and he was up to the challenge,"" said Rizwan. Rizwan revealed the plan was to set a target for the last 20 overs. ""It was a supporting pitch so we decided that we will not look at the board and take a target of 20 overs and that paid off,"" said Rizwan of the 163-run target in the last 20 overs. ""Shafique built the innings and that made the chase easy."" Rizwan said Pakistan will play with the same plan against India. ""Our next match is against India and this will give us confidence and we will go with the same plan,"" said Rizwan of the high-profile clash in Ahmedabad on Saturday. Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana said his team was 20 runs short. ""I think the turning point was the last 10 overs because we lost more than 20 runs,"" said Theekshana of the 344-9 total. ""Even in the bowling we made a lot of mistakes and we didn't execute our plans."" Theekshana believed Pakistan bowlers were clever in execution. ""Actually, the wicket was a little bit slow in the last 10 overs and they bowled a lot of slower balls and we didn't execute our plans really well.""

"The West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran was left a disappointed figure in the middle as rookie batter Kacey Carty threw his wicket away after staging a mini-recovery for the home side in the third and final ODI in Guyana today. Pooran is leading from the front and took 93 balls to score his ninth fifty of his ODI career as the Windies find themselves on 120 for five after 37.3 overs. Big-hitter Rovman Powell was the latest to depart to become Taijul Islam's third victim of the day so far. The hosts, after reeling on 19 for three, pulled off their first fifty partnership of the series when Carty dispatched a Mehedi Miraz delivery with a lofted on drive over the long on. However, four overs later, a mistimed shot saw Carty scoop one in the air to get dismissed, out for a 66-ball 33 against the run of play. In the process, Nasum Ahmed -- player-of-the-match of the previous game – had his first wicket of the game with a short-pitched ball but Carty, while batting on 19, could've been Afif Hossain's scalp instead had wicket-keeper Nurul Hasan Sohan grabbed the catch following a faint outside-edge.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Three Bangladeshi cricketers enlisted their names on the 13th edition of the Big Bash T20 League players draft, with the league scheduled to begin on December 7. Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, young pacer Ripon Mondol and women's team pacer Jahanara Alam registered their names for the draft for franchise league's players draft. Cricket Australia (CA) on Monday revealed the names of 376 male cricketers from 29 countries for the men's draft, while there were 122 women cricketers in women's draft. The players draft for both the men's and women's Big Bash will take place on Sunday. Ripon, who played just two T20 games, had registered his name in the previous edition of the draft as well alongside pacers Al Amin Hossain and Shafiul Islam, but none of the teams showed interest to pick any of them. Taijul, on the other hand, picked up 76 wickets in 93 T20s but is yet to feature in any foreign franchise league. Jahanara, however, has been a regular face in the Fairbreak Invitational T20 League in Hong Kong while also playing in Women's T20 Challenge Velocity in India in 2020. Shakib Al Hasan remains the only Bangladeshi cricketer to feature in the Big Bash league, his stint in 2014 saw him play two games for Adelaide Strikers and four matches for Melbourne Renegades in 2015. The upcoming edition of the Big Bash is scheduled to run from December 7 to January 24 next year.

"Indian captain Hardik Pandya called on his batsmen to take more responsibility and support their bowlers in future after openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill showed the way in Saturday's series-levelling Twenty20 win over the West Indies in Florida. Chasing 179 to level the five-match series at 2-2 after superb knocks by Shai Hope (45) and Shimron Hetmyer (61) lifted the West Indies, India cruised home in Lauderhill with three overs to spare, losing only one wicket along the way. The impressive Jaiswal was unbeaten on 84 off 51 balls after smashing 11 fours and three sixes, while Gill was equally fluent during his 77 off 47 balls before being dismissed by Romario Shepherd in the 16th over. ""Gill and Jaiswal were brilliant,"" said Pandya, who is leading an India side in the absence of several frontline players. ""There's no doubt over their skill set. ""They just needed to spend some time between the wickets. ""Going forward we have to take more responsibility as a batting group and support the bowlers. I've always believed bowlers win matches."" Pandya said he was happy to see his team show some steel after losing the opening two matches of the series. ""The (last) two games we played reflected that we pulled up our socks and made sure to play good cricket,"" Pandya said. ""In T20 cricket no one is a favourite. You have to turn up and play good cricket. You have to respect the opposition. They were 2-0 up because they played better cricket than us. ""Tomorrow (Sunday), we have to turn up and do exactly what we did today."" Jaiswal, who hit his maiden T20 half-century after shining during the test series earlier, said he had full belief in his ability to deliver despite the switch to a different format. ""It's all about the mindset. I believe in myself and I trust in myself,"" Jaiswal said. ""If I give everything it can happen.

"Mushfiqur Rahim's announcement to retire from the T20 format for Bangladesh yesterday was welcomed by the Tigers' fans as a timely one. There were mixed reactions from the Bangladeshi supporters on social media. However, the majority of them were seen praising Mushfiqur's decision. In the recent past, the 35-year-old has found himself in the firing line for his dismal performances in the shortest format of the game, and the wicketkeeper-batter received ample criticism during the ongoing Asia Cup 2022, where he failed to make his presence felt with the bat and also remained ineffective behind the stumps. Mushfiqur scored five runs in two matches and was guilty of putting down the opportunity to remove player-of-the-match Kusal Mendis early in the second game against Sri Lanka. Moreover, he did not attempt to convince the skipper Shakib Al Hasan of a caught-behind dismissal after Mendis nicked an Ebadot Hossain delivery later in the game, which Bangladesh lost by two wickets to end their Asia Cup campaign. Previously, Tamim Iqbal announced his retirement from T20 format through a Facebook post earlier this year after Mahmudullah Riyad retired from the Test format, in a rather mysterious fashion, the year before. Mahmudullah officially announced his retirement four months after he was given a guard of honour in his 50th Test, played against Zimbabwe in Harare last year. Following that Test, a number of Bangladesh players paid their tribute to Mahmudullah through social media, but Mahmudullah, or anyone else for that matter, made no official announcement in this regard at the time. Mushfiqur, however, followed protocols and had officially sent a letter to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) before announcing his decision publicly, the chairman of the cricket operations committee, Jalal Yunus, confirmed the news to The Daily Star. ""Mushfiqur has given an official letter to the board regarding his retirement from the T20 format. Obviously, his contribution to Bangladesh cricket is something we all have to accept. However, the board will sit and inform the decision regarding his retirement later,"" said Yunus. However, even though Mushfiqur sent a letter to the BCB informing of his decision beforehand, it can be argued that his methods lacked proper communication with the board as well. It certainly was in stark contrast with the way the ECB announced Ben Stokes' decision to step aside from ODIs in July. It only reflects the lack of trust that persists between the BCB and the players, regardless of the cricketers in question. In fact, Bangladesh's most successful skipper Mashrafe Bin Mortaza is still not officially retired from cricket even though it has been a common knowledge for a while that the cricketer is not draping the red and green in the future. Many are blaming the BCB for not providing the platform to the players to make a smooth transition, terming it as part of lacking the right process and culture in Bangladesh cricket. However, an influential board director requesting anonymity said that it's the players who need to make the call at the right time. ""Look, we notice the fact that the board often faces media trials in social media, which is not right. I think it's the players who should come forward and call it a day as only they know better when is the right time to say goodbye,"" the BCB official said. Apart from Mushfiqur's poor performance in the Asia Cup that prompted him to retire from the T20 format, it was also learned that both Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah are not in the long-term plans of Sridhar Sriram, the Tigers' newly hired Technical Consultant, which the wicket-keeper batter also took that into account before making the call. Since the retirement of Mushfiqur from T20Is, the focus has now shifted towards Mahmudullah for his string of below-par performances, leading to many fans now demanding his retirement from the format ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup later this year. Only time will tell whether Mahmudullah follows the same route as his brother-in-law. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh batter Mushfiqur Rahim said that he wanted to better Bangladesh's best World Cup finish at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. The veteran, who has played in four ODI World Cups, is set to feature in his fifth, yet again as a pivotal player in the middle-order of the Tigers' batting lineup. ""I am lucky to have played in the last four World Cups. If I get the chance to play this time, then I would definitely want to do better than the results we've had in the past four tournaments,"" Mushfiqur told the reporters. ""We have that ability and the belief but everything depends on starting well on the given day. I think it is very important that we start well."" ""Since we are an experienced side in ODIs and have been playing consistent cricket for the last four-five years. So we can hope that we can accomplish a good result,"" he added. Bangladesh's best-ever finish in a World Cup came in 2015 when they reached the quarterfinal of the tournament where they were knocked out by India. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) governing council named 203 local players in the players' draft for the auction, scheduled to be held at a city hotel in Dhaka tomorrow. The players will be divided into six categories with the highest payment of Tk 80 lakhs from Category A. Mushfiqur Rahim is the only player in the top category. Category B consists four cricketers (BDT 50 Lakh), 18 players in category C (BDT 30 Lakh), 31 cricketers in D category (BDT 20 Lakh), 75 cricketers in E category (BDT 15 Lakh), 29 players in F category (BDT 10 Lakh), and 45 cricketers in G category (BDT 5 Lakhs). On the other hand a total of 443 foreign cricketers were placed in six categories of the players draft with the salary ranging from USD 80000 to USD 20000. Meanwhile, the selectors have not named national cricketer Nasir Hossain in the players draft due to an ongoing investigation on the player by the International Cricket Council for corruption charges. Nasir is amongst eight players, officials, and team owners charged with breaching various counts of the Anti-Corruption Code during the 2021 Abu Dhabi T10 League. The upcoming edition of the BPL will be held in January next year. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The lone Test against Afghanistan ended in emphatic fashion for the hosts on Saturday but a few Bangladesh players have already begun training individually at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium indoor nets yesterday. While veteran batter Mushfiqur Rahim was seen sweating it out and seemingly in search of adding a few new shots to his repertoire, the likes of pacer Hasan Mahmud also underwent a session with the bat at the indoor nets on the eve of official white-ball practice, starting from today. Hasan's bowling partner, Taskin Ahmed, suggested earlier that the upcoming ODI series against Afghanistan -- scheduled to begin from July 5 -- will ""be challenging"". ""Everyone had been preparing well [with white ball] even before the Test began. We are hopeful of something good, although it won't be easy [in the ODIs against Afghanistan],"" Taskin said following a commercial event on Monday. Taskin relayed the emphatic 546-run Test win ""is in the past now"" and that the ""next game will begin from the first ball"". The Tigers' pace spearhead believes their work will now begin anew to maintain growth of improvement, with two major tournaments in sight. ""The pacers are doing well but everything will start with focus on that match [on July 05]. ""Normally, Chattogram offers sporting, batting-friendly wickets. However, we are all hopeful that if we can maintain our consistency in terms of improvement, everyone will be gradually prepared for the upcoming World Cup and Asia Cup,"" Taskin concluded. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh's wicketkeeper-batter Mushfiqur Rahim is slated to return to the country after the match against Sri Lanka, team management sources have confirmed to The Daily Star. Mushfiqur's wife is expecting, which is why the experienced batter would return to the country after the second Super Four game against Sri Lanka on Saturday. There will not be any replacements needed for Mushfiqur as he is expected to join the team before Bangladesh's last Super Four game against India. ""He will return to the country after the game [against Sri Lanka]. His wife is expecting, so it will happen after this game [Sri Lanka game]. The next game is on 15th [September], so there's a break of 6-7 days and he will head back [to Sri Lanka],"" the source said. Bangladesh lost their first Super Four game against Pakistan by seven wickets. The team management would be happy to get Mushfiqur's services during this critical period as the Tigers now need to get results in their remaining games to make it to the final. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Rohit Sharma's India face underdogs Sri Lanka in Sunday's Asia Cup final, a crucial momentum-builder heading into next month's ODI World Cup. The cricketing giants have 13 Asian titles between them and Sri Lanka have a history of sneaking into the tournament's final -- to the consternation of fans keen for any showdown between arch-rivals India and Pakistan. Bangladesh ended India's unbeaten run in the 50-over tournament after edging them out by six runs in Friday's last Super Four match. Shubman Gill hit 121 but his knock went in vain after India faltered in their chase of 266 in Colombo, where Sunday's final will also be held. ""I don't think it has broken our momentum,"" Gill told reporters after the narrow defeat. ""We have played good cricket. Sometimes it happens on these wickets. I was set and should have finished off the game."" Gill said clinching India's eighth Asia Cup title would give them ""confidence"" ahead of the World Cup starting back home on October 5. India began with a washed-out match in Pallekele against Pakistan, whose fast bowlers rattled their top order and bowled them out for 266 in the only innings possible due to rain. Big guns Virat Kohli and returning batsman KL Rahul hit back with centuries in their next outing against Babar Azam's team to rack up 356-2 and crush Pakistan by 228 runs. India then prevented a gutsy Sri Lankan chase to book their place in the final, but Gill said their opponents were still a threat. ""We will have to pull up our socks and be at our 100 percent to beat them,"" he said. Sri Lanka, who won the previous edition of the Asia Cup played in the T20 format, came in as underdogs and snuck into the Super Fours with a dramatic win over Afghanistan. They soon got into their groove on home soil and, despite going down to India, edged out Pakistan in a knockout match for their 11th Asia Cup final. ""We came without our key players, but still we managed to make the finals,"" skipper Dasun Shanaka said. Injuries sidelined Dushmantha Chameera and Wanindu Hasaranga, but others stood up at crucial junctures. Kusal Mendis and Charith Asalanka both hit match-winning knocks to take the team over the line in a rain-shortened match and push a much-favoured Pakistan out of the tournament. Up-and-coming fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana and left-arm spinner Dunith Wellalage have impressed and lead the tournament's bowling chart with 11 and 10 wickets respectively. Wellalage rattled India's batting with five wickets including the prized scalps of Kohli and Rohit in their Super Four match. Twice before in the Asia Cup Sri Lanka have lost to India in the Super Four stage only to beat them in the finals, in 2004 and 2008. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Rohit Sharma has led India from the front in their three unbeaten matches of the World Cup to boost his cricket-mad nation's hopes of winning the title at home. The Indian captain has already amassed 217 runs including a record century against Afghanistan, showing no signs of the pressure on his shoulders. Rohit succeeded superstar Virat Kohli as white-ball captain in 2021 with the aim of securing the national team a third World Cup and first international title since the 2013 Champions Trophy. Australia great Ricky Ponting lavished praise on Rohit for handling the pressure of the job with ease. ""Someone like Virat, who is a bit more heart-on-the-sleeve, and probably listens to the fans and plays up with the fans a little bit more, someone with his personality would probably find it a bit harder,"" Ponting wrote in an International Cricket Council column on Tuesday. ""But I think Rohit will be fine with it. He's a terrific bloke and has been a great player for a long time, and he's done a great job as leader of India."" Rohit, 36, has enjoyed franchise success as a skipper with five IPL titles with the Mumbai Indians and then led India to the Asia Cup title last month in a key test of form ahead of the World Cup. That success would have helped ease a little of the pain suffered when, under his captaincy, India were defeated in the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup in Australia last year. Rohit has never let expectations get to him and Ponting, once his captain at Mumbai and then coach, said the veteran batsman takes pressure in his stride. ""He's very laid back,"" said Ponting. ""You can even see that by the way that he plays. He's a pretty laconic sort of batsman as well, and that's the way he is both on and off the field."" Rohit, an opening batsman nicknamed ""Hitman"" for his ability to get big scores quickly, was out for a duck in the team's opening win against Australia, but was lauded for his captaincy moves. He soon regained form with 131 against Afghanistan as he surpassed compatriot Sachin Tendulkar with a record seventh World Cup century. His ton in 63 balls was the fastest by an Indian in a World Cup to better Kapil Dev's hundred in 72 balls against Zimbabwe in 1983. Rohit took his form to the hotly-anticipated clash with arch-rivals Pakistan and smashed a match-winning 86 to thrash the opposition as India climbed to the top of the 10-team World Cup table. In his career, he has accumulated 10,329 ODI runs including 31 centuries in 254 matches since his debut in 2007. Rohit, who was not selected for India's last World Cup triumph at home in 2011, said he relishes the role of being leader. ""Nothing in life is impossible, you can make it possible if you have the belief,"" Rohit said. ""If you trust in it, if you have the will to go forward, it's everyone's dream firstly to be part of the team and then to captain the team is definitely the icing on the cake. I never thought I would be captain one day."" ""I also believe that good things happen to good people. I kept my head straight, kept working hard on my game. I am sitting here today with a wonderful opportunity to bring glory to this beautiful country."" Rohit's deputy in the World Cup, Hardik Pandya praised the leader for his ability to bring the best out of players through his faith in them. ""Since he has come, he has backed a lot of boys and we see the result now as well with how the boys are going and expressing themselves,"" all-rounder Pandya said. ""So that's why Rohit has been special in giving them enough opportunity and at the same time telling them that 'you know what, I got your back'."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"From being brutally trolled on social media at the beginning of his career to becoming the mainstay of Bangladesh's batting line-up in recent years, Najmul Hossain Shanto has come a long way as a cricketer. The 25-year-old, who is set to play his maiden ODI World Cup, will definitely play a crucial role for the Tigers in the mega event in India. The in-form batter opened up about his game, and expectations from the showpiece event along with a few other topics during an exclusive interview with The Daily Star's Mazhar Uddin. The excerpts of the interview are given below: The Daily Star (DS): This will be your maiden ODI World Cup. What are your expectations from this event? Najmul Hossain Shanto (NHS): To be honest, I don't want to keep any expectations since what is more important for us is how well we can do as a team. If I talk about expectations, my aim will be to perform for my team in every match. However, I am not thinking about the outcome. I will try to do my best in every situation and play according to the demands of my team. DS: What is your favourite Bangladesh World Cup memory? NHS: The first thing that comes to my mind is the 2015 World Cup game against England. I think it was a memorable tournament for us as we qualified for the quarterfinals for the first time. I was playing for the Under-15 side back then and I can remember the cheer from all of us when Rubel [Hossain] bhai bowled Stuart Broad [James Anderson] to win the game. I must also mention Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai's performance in the 2019 World Cup where he was terrific throughout the tournament. DS: Now you seem to enjoy your time in the middle even in tough situations. What sort of change in mindset did you have? NHS: At one point I think the expectations piled up on me and I was unable to enjoy the game which is the reason it hampered my performance. What I do now is, whether I score runs or not, whether my team is in a good or bad position, I try to enjoy the game. DS: As you bat at a crucial position and the team also relies heavily on you, how do you see your role as a batter? NHS: I don't see myself differently or think of any extra responsibilities. Whenever I go to bat, I think of giving my best for the team according to the demands of the situation. Obviously, my position is very important and yes, we haven't had consistency at the top order recently and maybe we didn't do well in the last four or five games. But I think if we don't overthink this aspect and if we can bat according to our plan, we can do better. What I do is try to focus on my strengths and do what is within my capacity, refraining from doing anything extraordinary. DS: Any specific bowler in world cricket you think can pose threat to the batters? NHS: To be honest, I don't think of any individual bowler. I try to focus on the ball and not on who's bowling. Obviously, there are some great bowlers in world cricket who make life difficult for the batters such as Mitchell Starc, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Trent Boult and a few others who can be devastating on their given day. DS: As a team, what are the expectations from the upcoming World Cup? NHS: We can expect a lot of things and as a team, our expectation is very high. But rather revealing our expectations the important thing for us will be to focus on how good we can play match by match. I can say we will try to achieve what Bangladesh have never achieved in the World Cup, and the type of team we are, we will play to become champions. But it's also important we don't think too far. The team we have and if we remain fit, I hope it's possible for us to get a very good result. The other thing is that we will have the same expectations and goals throughout the tournament. The sentiment of the general people or the media is that we become a very bad team when we lose a game and drastically become a great team when we win a game. But as players, we do not think that way. We go to the ground to win every game. DS: What is your favourite Bangladesh World Cup memory? NHS: The first thing that comes to my mind is the 2015 World Cup game against England. I think it was a memorable tournament for us as we qualifed for the quarterfinals for the first time. I was playing for the Under-15 side back then and I can remember the cheer from all of us when Rubel [Hossain] bhai bowled Stuart Broad [James Anderson] to win the game. I must also mention Shakib [Al Hasan] bhai's performance in the 2019 World Cup where he was terrific throughout the tournament. DS: Any specific bowler in world cricket you think can pose threat to the batters? NHS: To be honest, I don't think of any individual bowler. I try to focus on the ball and not on who's bowling. Obviously, there are some great bowlers in world cricket who make life difficult for the batters such as Mitchell Starc, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Trent Boult and a few others who can be devastating on their given day. DS: You performed consistently in all formats recently. Having gone through a lot of ups and downs at the start of your career, what are the things that played a role in your transformation? NHS: Obviously, I did not have a smooth start to my international career. Everyone expected a lot from me. But to be honest, I haven't made huge changes as I tried to work on my mistakes and analysed my shortcomings in the nets, and worked specifically on those. I think it is because of those specific works that I am getting the results now. But I must say that I went through an important phase of my career when I changed my training pattern along with my mindset. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh fell to their first ODI series defeat against Afghanistan after losing the first two ODIs at Chattogram's Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury. Ahead of the third ODI, the biggest question was how the Bangladesh batters would turn it around against Afghanistan spinners. Far from talking about what progress they have been able to make as a batting unit, the Bangladesh assistant coach Nic Pothas said that every team struggles against them and not just Bangladesh batters. The Afghanistan spinners Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman had a field day against Bangladesh batters, who struggled to read the mystery spinners. Afghanistan are ranked ninth in the ICC ODI rankings. Their ODI series wins before this series have come against sides like Scotland, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Netherlands. Pothas maintained that it was a good challenge to face their mystery spinners. ""They are ranked below us, but two of those spinners are among the top three spinners in the world. We are looking at it with a very positive outlook,"" he said. Even as Tigers batters struggled, Pothas wanted to clarify at the press conference today that Bangladesh batters were not the only one having a difficult time reading the spinners out of the hand. ""I think it is not a question of whether we struggled to pick them. It is a question of how the world struggles to pick them. Where they are ranked in the world will tell you everybody in the world struggle pick them. I had Mujeeb with me at Middlesex. Even after I was talking to him as a wicketkeeper, I struggled to pick him from behind. Could everyone pick Shane Warne, Muralitharan? That's why they are the best in the world. That's why every competition in the world puts up so much money for mystery spin. Question is, what are we going to do about it, and how is it going to make us better?"" he said. However, what they wanted to do about it was not clear. Pothas felt they are learning. There is always going to be progress but under pressure you are always going to revert to type. These things take time and I understand that you guys want it to happen quickly but it doesn't happen quickly. That's not the way of the world,"" he added. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Rahul Dravid will stay on as India head coach following an extension of his contract, which had expired with the 50-overs home World Cup earlier this month, the country's cricket board said on Wednesday. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) did not reveal the duration of the extension but it is likely to cover the T20 World Cup in West Indies and the United States in June. ""The BCCI engaged in productive discussions with Rahul Dravid after the term of his contract ended ... and unanimously agreed to further the tenure,"" the board said in a statement. The BCCI acknowledged Dravid's ""exceptional professionalism"" as coach of the side which reached the finals of the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup this year losing to Australia on both occasions. The board also praised former test batter VVS Laxman, who was expected to succeed Dravid in the role having occasionally filled in for his former India team mate, saying he had shown ""exemplary"" service. BCCI secretary Jay Shah said Dravid had made India a ""formidable"" force. ""Team India is now a formidable unit across formats, and our top ranking in all three formats directly reflects his vision, guidance, and the roadmap he charted for the team,"" he added. ""Having won 10 consecutive games before the final, our World Cup campaign was nothing short of extraordinary, and the head coach deserves appreciation for setting up the right platform for the team to flourish."" Dravid said he thoroughly enjoyed the last two years in charge of the side. ""I am genuinely proud of the culture we have set in the dressing room,"" the 50-year-old said. ""I thank the BCCI and the office bearers for placing their trust in me, endorsing my vision, and providing support during this period."" ""As we embrace new challenges post the World Cup, we remain committed to the pursuit of excellence."" Laxman is currently guiding a second-string India squad in a five-match T20 series against Australia.

"Rahul Dravid has decided not to continue as the head coach of the India cricket team, claimed a report in Times of India. According to the report, the legendary India cricketer has decided not to extend his contract, which ended with the World Cup where India lost to Australia in the final. The report said that Dravid has communicated his decision to the BCCI already. Dravid is set to be replaced by VVS Laxman, who is currently leading the team in the five-match T20I series against Australia starting today. The report also quoted an unnamed source inside the BCCI who said that Laxman, who has helmed the coach's job temporarily in absence of Dravid, is keen on taking the role full-time and wants to sign a long-term contract. Following the five-match T20I series against Australia at home, India will travel to South Africa to play a T20 series. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Forward Rakib Hossain and defender Saad Uddin will not be eligible to play when Bangladesh host Lebanon in their second World Cup qualifying fixture at the Bashundhara Kings Arena on November 21. Bangladesh suffered a 7-0 thrashing by Australia in their opening match in Melbourne on Thursday and will host the Lebanese, who were held to a goalless draw by Palestine in the other group match on the same day. Both Bangladesh and Lebanon teams are in Dhaka now, the hosts having arrived last night following a long journey from Australia while Lebanon had arrived earlier yesterday morning. Rakib and Saad, two very important players of the team, received yellow cards in the match against Australia. They had also received yellow cards against Maldives in the qualifying playoff last month. According to the FIFA regulation, the disciplinary actions from the playoff round will count during the group stage too, the Bangladesh team management learnt through a e-mail from FIFA after landing in Dhaka on Friday night. The suspensions come as a blow to coach Javier Cabrera's plans of salvaging a result against Lebanon following the demoralising start to the campaign. The last time Bangladesh had met Lebanon was in the SAFF Championship earlier this year when the middle eastern side won 2-0.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Griezmann's superb header after 64 minutes split the teams, although visitors Mallorca spurned some good openings in the final stages. Atletico midfielder Koke, the club's record appearance maker, hit a milestone of 600 games for the club. ""The match was very hard for us, Mallorca played a very serious game,"" Koke told Movistar. The goal was Griezmann's 301st in his career and he is rapidly closing in on Luis Aragones' club record of 173 -- the French forward has 170 for Atletico. ""(Griezmann) will be living history at Atletico Madrid, he will surpass Luis Aragones,"" added Koke. The hosts were on top from the start at the Metropolitano, with Angel Correa firing their best chance of the first half over early on. Diego Simeone's side dominated the ball but Mallorca defended well, keeping the Rojiblancos at arm's length. Neither goalkeeper was tested until Mallorca's Predrag Rajkovic stopped an Alvaro Morata header early in the second half. Atletico eventually moved ahead when Griezmann arced a brilliant header home from Mario Hermoso's cross. Jan Oblak made a good save from Gio Gonzalez with 10 minutes remaining and was grateful to see former Atletico youth player Amath Ndiaye fire wide when well-placed. Atletico visit Feyenoord in the Champions League on Tuesday night, knowing they can reach the last 16 with a victory. Mallorca, 17th, are one point clear of the relegation zone but have played one fewer match than the three teams below them. ""We had some clear chances ... heads up, we go on,"" Mallorca defender Martin Valjent told Movistar. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Alvaro Morata scored a brace to help Atletico Madrid deliver a statement performance as they outclassed city rivals Real Madrid in a 3-1 derby win in LaLiga on Sunday. Morata opened the scoring in the fourth minute in a sold-out Metropolitano stadium with a towering header from a Samuel Lino cross and Antoine Griezmann extended Atletico's lead with another header in the 18th minute, from a Saul Niguez cross. Real's Toni Kroos struck home from the edge of the box in the 35th minute but Morata headed Atletico's third goal in the first minute of the second half, from another cross by Saul. With one game in hand, Atletico moved up to fifth place in the LaLiga standings on 10 points, while Real Madrid, who entered the weekend as leaders, are now third on 15 points, one behind Barcelona and Girona. Diego Simeone's Atletico dominated proceedings for most of the match and spent the final minutes of the game passing the ball sideways to each other as their delirious fans chanted ""Ole, ole, ole"" in a thunderous show of support. After Morata had scored the opener, his team mate Jose Maria Gimenez wasted a golden opportunity in the 10th minute, missing a close-range header from a corner kick sent in by Griezmann, who himself headed in the second goal eight minutes later. Midfielder Eduardo Camavinga had Real's first chance in the 30th minute, with a curling shot from range that was deflected to a corner. Goalkeeper Jan Oblak denied a Federico Valverde first-touch strike from the corner and started off a quick counter-attack that almost ended with Atletico's third, with goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga making a brilliant one-handed save of a Saul strike. Real's Kroos then made it 2-1 before Camavinga had a goal ruled out just before the break for offside in the build-up. Real struggled to create any more chances after Morata's second goal in the opening moments of the second half. ""Very happy for all these people that came here today and delivered this amazing support"", Morata told DAZN. ""I said the other day, the fans were going to play the most important role. That's how it has been. It's been an incredible atmosphere."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Barcelona missed out on signing LA Galaxy defender Julian Araujo on transfer deadline day as they were 18 seconds late in registering the paperwork, director of football Mateu Alemany said. Barca had been trying to sign the 21-year-old right back for $6.5 million in a deal until 2026, Spanish newspaper Diario AS reported. ""We couldn't register due to a system error, it was just 18 seconds, we'll see what FIFA say,"" Barca's Alemany told Movistar on Wednesday, a day after the window closed. Barcelona did not make any major signings in January, while Hector Bellerin left for Sporting Lisbon and Memphis Depay joined Atletico Madrid.

"Real Madrid are closing in on Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham, with Spanish reports Wednesday saying a deal will soon be reached. The England international, 19, is one of the brightest prospects in world football and is poised to move for over 100 million euros ($110 million), with Dortmund said to want considerably more. Bellingham excelled at the World Cup with England in 2022 and has also drawn interest from Madrid's Champions League semi-final opponents Manchester City. The midfielder signed for Dortmund at 17 from Championship team Birmingham City for 29 million euros ($32 million) and has become a key player for the German side. Spanish newspaper Marca say any deal between Madrid and Dortmund will not be announced until the end of the Bundesliga season, with Bellingham's side a point behind leaders Bayern Munich in the title race. Madrid are looking to find long-term replacements for their veteran players, including midfielders Luka Modric, 37, and Toni Kroos, 33. Los Blancos brought in young French duo Eduardo Camavinga and Aurelien Tchouameni over the past two summer transfer windows and sold holding midfielder Casemiro to Manchester United.

"Jude Bellingham's stunning double snatched Real Madrid a 2-1 comeback victory at Barcelona in his first La Liga Clasico on Saturday. The England international, who has started his Madrid career in remarkable goalscoring form, unleashed a rocket into the top corner from distance after Ilkay Gundogan had sent hosts Barcelona ahead at the Olympic Stadium. Bellingham then fired home a second in stoppage time to silence Barcelona fans and reach 10 goals in the top flight this season. Barcelona hit the woodwork twice and had the better of the game but Bellingham, La Liga's top goalscorer, is in unstoppable form and inevitably made his mark in his first Clasico. Bellingham's brace sent Madrid to the top of La Liga, ahead of Girona on goal difference, with both teams four points ahead of Barcelona in third. ""He seems like a veteran... the goal to level it totally changed the game,"" said Ancelotti of Madrid's 20-year-old match-winner. ""What was surprising today was his shot, he's always arriving in the box, today he scored a stupendous goal from in front of the area."" Barcelona were boosted by the returns of Robert Lewandowski, Jules Kounde and Raphinha from injury, with Xavi naming them on the bench, but Frenkie de Jong and Pedri did not recover in time. His counterpart Carlo Ancelotti selected Ferland Mendy at left back over Eduardo Camavinga and Fran Garcia, once again deploying Bellingham in the number 10 role as he got his first taste of arguably the world's biggest club football match. However it was another midfielder playing for the first time in the Clasico who broke the deadlock -- Barcelona's summer arrival Gundogan. The former Manchester City man was sharpest when Aurelien Tchouameni intercepted Ferran Torres' pass, diverting it back into his own area. Centre-back David Alaba tried to clear but was thoroughly unconvincing and Gundogan read his intentions, hopped onto the ball and swept past Kepa Arrizabalaga in the sixth minute. Post denies Barca Fermin Lopez, one of the emerging young Barcelona La Masia academy products who has broken into the first team, slapped a shot against the post after the intense Gavi pressed high to win the ball back. Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger hammered wide from nearly 40 yards out as Madrid were held off by the hosts, with winger Vinicius Junior getting into tangles with Gavi and Ronald Araujo, deployed at right-back to try and shackle him. After Araujo barged the Brazilian, he protested, with Xavi telling him it was just a shoulder charge, although the Barcelona coach could not defend Ferran Torres' rugby tackle on Vinicius just before half-time, which earned him a yellow card. Gavi, Gundogan and Lopez controlled the midfield, with Joao Cancelo's more advanced position allowing Barcelona additional defensive security. Barcelona struck the woodwork again when Inigo Martinez headed Lopez's inch-perfect cross against the post early in the second half, with Arrizabalaga thwarting Araujo on the follow-up. Madrid were reduced to long-range efforts but eventually one ripped into the net to level the score, with just over 20 minutes remaining. Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved a Tchouameni piledriver but he could not keep out Bellingham's blast, pulling Madrid level in a game they had struggled to find a foothold in. With the game heading towards an unsatisfying draw for both sides, Bellingham intervened decisively -- in the right place at the right time to shoot through Ter Stegen's legs after Luka Modric diverted Dani Carvajal's cross into his path. ""I'm not someone who evaluates the opposition team, he scored two goals, he did it for Real Madrid and he changed the game,"" Ter Stegen told DAZN. ""We had it, the game, going in our favour and we didn't know how to keep it that way."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior said he saw racist abuse by a ""child"" during his team's 1-1 draw at Sevilla on Saturday in La Liga. Sevilla expelled a supporter for ""racist and xenophobic behaviour"", the club said in a statement, with Vinicius thanking them for their quick action, as well as highlighting another incident. Spanish newspaper Marca ran photographs of a man appearing to make monkey gestures in the direction of the Brazil winger after he clashed with Sevilla goalkeeper Orjan Nyland. Vinicius shared the same picture on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, and said in addition, he had seen a video of a child making a racist gesture. ""Congratulations to Sevilla for their quick positioning (on the incident) and punishment in yet another sad episode for Spanish football,"" wrote Vinicius. ""Unfortunately, I had access to a video of another racist gesture in Saturday's match, this time carried out by a child. ""I am very sorry there is no-one to educate you. I invest, and I invest a lot, in education in Brazil to help form citizens with different attitudes to these."" A video circulating on social media appears to show a teenage girl making a monkey gesture at Vinicius. The Brazilian winger has been the victim of racist abuse on various occasions during his time in Spain, although often no action has been taken by the law. Vinicius testified before a Spanish court on October 5 by videoconference as part of an investigation into alleged abuse he suffered at Valencia in May. The winger stopped the game at the Mestalla Stadium to face off with a fan he believed was abusing him. ""I hope the Spanish authorities do their part and change the legislation once and for all,"" continued Vinicius on X. ""These people must be criminally punished too. It would be a great first step in preparing for the 2030 World Cup. I'm available to help.

"Surprise package Girona failed to return to the top of La Liga on Monday after they were held 1-1 draw at home by Athletic Bilbao. Winger Viktor Tsygankov put the hosts ahead 10 minutes after half time but Inaki Williams scored 12 minutes later to claim a point for the away side. Girona trail league leaders Real Madrid on goal difference after dropping points for just the third time this season, while Athletic climbed to fifth spot. Athletic had the better of the first half and their best chance fell to Gorka Guruzeta but the striker poked his shot straight at Girona goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga. Girona had early chances of their own including an Aleix Garcia volley, which he skied over the crossbar, but did not find the rhythm they have found so often this season. After the break, the hosts broke the deadlock when Tsygankov rifled home. Williams, who started on the opposite wing from his brother Nico, equalised from a counter-attacking move that started in Athletic's own box. The wide man finished smoothly for his sixth league goal of the season as the Basques went looking for their third straight win. With 10 minutes left Inaki Williams came close to finding the winner as he cut in from the left but his shot was parried by Gazzaniga. Inaki Williams was replaced in the final minute of normal time for youngster Adu Ares, but both sides were forced to settle for a point. On Sunday, Rodrygo sent Real Madrid top with a double in 3-0 win at Cadiz.

"Bilbao posted a leaving message from Laporte on their Twitter feed, saying his 65 million euros ($80 million) release clause had been paid. It means Pep Guardiola's City are set to surpass the £55 million they paid for Belgium attacking midfielder Kevin de Bruyne -- Laporte's transfer fee translates as £57 million. The 23-year-old will also become the second most expensive defender in history behind Virgil Van Dijk, who cost Liverpool £75 million from Southampton earlier this month. Bilbao said in a statement that Laporte had ""completed the requirements for the valid unilateral resolution of his work contract"". It means he is now free to sign for City. Laporte thanked Athletic's fans in his Twitter message but said he was taking on ""a new challenge in my professional career"". ""I don't want this to be a goodbye but rather a see you soon,"" he said. ""Here, I'm leaving a unique and different club and I'll never forget it."" Born in southwest France, Laporte moved to Bilbao's youth team in 2010 and made his debut in 2012 under firebrand Argentine coach Marcelo Bielsa. He was once a reported target for Barcelona and City wanted to sign him in the close season but he rejected the move. His release clause was 50 million euros at the time. His signing will mean Guardiola has spent more than £200 million simply on reinforcing his defence alongside the acquisitions of Benjamin Mendy (£52m), John Stones (£47.5m) and Kyle Walker (£45m). A France international at all youth levels, Laporte has been frustrated at continually being overlooked by senior team coach Didier Deschamps. He has even mooted the possibility of representing Spain but will now be hoping a high-profile move to the Premier League leaders will catch Deschamps's attention. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pep Guardiola has denied tipping Brighton boss Roberto De Zerbi to be his successor at Manchester City. A recent report claimed Guardiola told a group of Brighton players his De Zerbi prediction after City drew at the Amex Stadium in May. Guardiola, whose City contract runs until 2025, reportedly said ""that's the next Manchester City manager"" about De Zerbi, whose impressive work with the Seagulls has earned him admiration across the Premier League. With Brighton visiting City on Saturday, Guardiola insisted he had no recollection of making the claim, but he was quick to lavish praise on the Italian. ""I don't remember that. Maybe I have bad memory but I'm sure Roberto can train in any team around the world. I don't have any doubt,"" Guardiola told reporters on Friday. ""I don't remember saying that to the players. I remember saying before he arrived, one or two games in, about sustaining the manager, but I don't remember saying that honestly. ""It's none of my business. If the chairman asks my opinion I will give my opinion but it's none of my business. ""I'm not the sporting director. It's not my responsibility to say what's going right or wrong."" Former Sassuolo and Shakhtar Donetsk boss De Zerbi has made a big impression since taking over at Brighton just over a year ago. He guided the club into European competition for the first time with a sixth-placed finish in the Premier League last season and they have started the current campaign strongly. Guardiola believes De Zerbi's impact shows a manager need not have had experience at the highest level to land the biggest jobs. ""It doesn't mean you have to be at the top clubs to be manager of the top clubs. I was appointed Barcelona first-team (manager) coming from the fourth division with no experience at the top level,"" he said. ""You have the idea of the club, the sporting director follows the idea, they hire the manager for this idea, they hire players to follow the idea. When that happens it's going well.

"Liverpool will become the latest team to attempt to storm Manchester City's Etihad fortress this weekend as Everton focus on Premier League survival following a punishing points deduction for breaching financial rules. Arsenal have a chance to top the table depending on results elsewhere, while Tottenham host high-flying Aston Villa. Here are three talking points ahead of the action as the English top flight returns following the international break. Liverpool seek to end Man City run Liverpool have been the only team to consistently challenge Manchester City in recent years, winning 10 out of 23 matches in all competitions under the reign of Jurgen Klopp. The two sides had epic battles in the 2018/19 and 2021/22 seasons, when City pipped their rivals by just a single point on both occasions, while the Reds clinched their first league title in 30 years in 2020. But Liverpool, revitalised after a below-par campaign last season, have not won a league game at the Etihad since their 4-1 demolition of City in November 2015. The reigning champions, by contrast, have won 23 matches in a row at home in all competitions. Erling Haaland is one goal away from obliterating the Premier League record for the quickest player to 50 goals -- the Norwegian scored twice in City's frantic 4-4 draw at Chelsea earlier this month to take his tally to 49 goals in just 47 appearances. Former Newcastle and Manchester United forward Andrew Cole is the current record holder, reaching the landmark in 65 games. Will 10-point penalty fire up Everton? Sean Dyche's Everton had turned the corner in recent weeks, winning three of their past five games to pull well clear of the relegation zone. But last week's 10-point deduction for breaching Premier League profitability and sustainability rules means they go into their match against Manchester United level on four points with bottom club Burnley. Everton director of football Kevin Thelwell said the team would now have added motivation, fuelled by a burning sense of injustice at the ""wholly disproportionate ruling"". Despite the sanction, the nine-time English champions are just two points from safety, thanks to the poor form of the newly promoted teams. United have climbed to sixth in the table after winning four of their past five league games but they are blunt in attack and remain unconvincing at the back. Spurs seek to stop rot against in-form Villa Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou made the best start to a season by a new manager in Premier League history after 10 games but the team has dropped off top spot due to consecutive defeats. Spurs were beaten 4-1 by Chelsea after being reduced to nine men and then lost 2-1 at Wolves in a game in which they were leading going into stoppage time. One headache Postecoglou must deal with is the absence of playmaker James Maddison, who has made such an impact since arriving in June but has been ruled out until the New Year with an ankle injury. Postecoglou will be wary of Aston Villa, who have continued their rapid progress under Unai Emery and are just a point behind fourth-placed Spurs and three points off the top. The Birmingham club's 3-1 win against Fulham earlier this month was a 13th successive home win -- a feat they last achieved 40 years ago. But their away form is less impressive, with just two wins from six games on the road. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Manchester City powered into the Champions League knockout stages as Erling Haaland banished fears over his fitness with a double in Tuesday's 3-0 win against Swiss side Young Boys. Pep Guardiola's team have won all four of their Group G matches, ensuring their progress to the last 16 with two games to spare. Haaland was fit to start at the Etihad Stadium after hurting his ankle in the first half of City's 6-1 win over Bournemouth on Saturday. And the Norway striker showed there was no lingering injury issue as he took his Champions League goal tally to a remarkable 39 in 34 matches. He put City ahead with a first-half penalty and netted again with a brilliant long-range effort after Phil Foden's eye-catching strike doubled the holders' lead. Young Boys had Sandro Lauper sent off in the second half of a one-sided contest that extended City's impressive streak of winning all 23 of their home games in 2023. Sunderland hold the English record with 24 successive home wins, a mark that dates back to 1891 and 1892. City are also unbeaten in their past 17 Champions League games and Guardiola now has the opportunity to rest players in the last two group matches if he wishes, instead prioritising Premier League fixtures against Tottenham and Crystal Palace. ""Of course we are incredibly happy to have qualified with two games left. Finish first in the group? We have time to think about it,"" Guardiola said. ""Maybe we were not sweet enough in the last moment to score more goals. But the word that defines this group for many years is consistency. ""We have high standards and that is why we are still in the Premier League up there and qualified from the Champions League."" The only dark clouds for Guardiola were injuries to John Stones, who faces a lengthy period out of action after suffering a first-half injury, and Manuel Akanji, who was replaced by Kyle Walker after sustaining a back problem in the pre-match warm-up. ""Manu had a problem in the back. Unfortunately John, he felt (injured) again. I feel so sorry for him,"" Guardiola said. ""It is a big loss for us. He is so important for what he does. He will recover, the season is long."" City defeated Young Boys 3-1 in Bern a fortnight ago and it didn't take long for the treble winners to reestablish their supremacy. Relentless City City's relentless pressure was rewarded in the 23rd minute when Matheus Nunes's deft turn drew a foul from Lauper in the Young Boys area. Haaland stepped up to take the penalty, calmly sending Anthony Racioppi the wrong way before marking the moment by replicating Didier Drogba's leaping goal celebration. Former Chelsea striker Drogba had challenged Haaland to copy either his or Gary Lineker's goal pose while presenting him with an award recently. Unable to convert Foden's cross soon afterwards, Haaland wore the wry smile of a man who knew more City goals were only a matter of time. Foden duly delivered in first-half stoppage time, conjuring a sublime solo effort as he controlled Jack Grealish's pass with a superb touch, skipped past Ulisses Garcia into the area and curled his shot into the far corner from five yards. After curiously swapping shirts with a Young Boys captain Mohamed Ali Camara at half-time, Haaland put the result beyond doubt in the 51st minute. Taking Rico Lewis's pass in stride, Haaland swivelled to unleash a thunderous strike that rocketed past Racioppi from the edge of the area. It was Haaland's 15th goal this season and his 67th in 70 games for City. Lauper was dismissed two minutes later for a second booking after a crude foul on Nathan Ake. With the game all but over, Guardiola was able to take off Haaland to rest him for Sunday's crucial Premier League trip to Chelsea. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"UEFA has started an investigation after sex noises disrupted the the broadcast of the Euro 2024 draw on Saturday. Lewd noises could be heard as Switzerland were drawn in Group A with Scotland, Hungary and hosts Germany. Host Giorgio Marchetti, the deputy general secretary of European football's governing body, attempted to take control of the situation, saying: ""There is some noise here that... has now stopped.

""I'm assuming it was some sort of a prank, but it was hard to really make out what it was,"" he said. YouTube prankster Daniel Jarvis claimed responsibility for both that and the latest prank. Jarvis broadcast himself live on X, formerly Twitter, ringing a mobile phone at intervals to trigger the noises as the Euros draw, which was streamed on the BBC, took place in Hamburg, Germany.

They were drawn to play Denmark, Slovenia and Serbia in Group C at the tournament next June, where they will be bidding to finally claim a first major title since the 1966 World Cup. Third in the latest FIFA world rankings, England are currently seen as the leading contenders to win the Euro along with France, the team that edged them out of last year's World Cup in the quarter-finals. ""We are third in the world rankings this week. We have been in the top five for five years, so consistently they have produced performances, so I think they are used to that,"" Southgate said of his team, who topped their Euro 2024 qualifying group ahead of Italy without losing a game. ""They have that expectation. They are used to playing in big matches together and individually, so we are excited and all looking forward to the tournament."" Under Southgate, England reached the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and lost the final of Euro 2020 on penalties to Italy, before their 2-1 defeat by France in the last eight in Qatar a year ago. That match was on a knife-edge and could have ended differently had Harry Kane not missed a late penalty. However, there is confidence that England might now be better equipped to go all the way in Germany next June and July given the current form of Kane at Bayern Munich and Jude Bellingham at Real Madrid in particular. ""We are very happy to have those players. We feel that the squad has been building for a long period of time and that England were going to be competitive for the foreseeable future,"" Southgate said. ""If you are continually in those latter stages, then most teams that win, that is what they do, they go close and they get there."" Kane has scored 22 goals in 18 games in all competitions for Bayern since his move to Germany from Tottenham Hotspur. ""He is a fabulous player,"" Southgate added. ""The games are a little bit different at the moment at Bayern, because they dominate their games so much. ""He is a very special player, so again he has won so many games for us, not just with his goals which is the obvious factor, but with his link play, his passing ability, the way he leads the line, so we are very fortunate to have him."" England will begin their Euro bid against Serbia, ranked 34th in the world, in the western city of Gelsenkirchen, home to Schalke 04, on June 16. They will follow that by going to Frankfurt to face Denmark on June 20 in a repeat of the Euro 2020 semi-final which England won 2-1 in extra time. Their final group game will be in Cologne on June 25 against Slovenia, who England defeated 1-0 at the 2010 World Cup. ""When Denmark came out first you are thinking ok, interesting,"" Southgate said when it was put to him that England had received a favourable draw. ""Of course everybody was thinking about Italy in one of the lower pots, and Croatia, but I have to say I think Serbia are a very dangerous opponent. ""And Slovenia takes me back to one of my first games as manager really, where but for Joe Hart making one of the best saves I have ever seen, I probably wouldn't be standing here,"" he added in reference to a 0-0 draw in Ljubljana in a World Cup qualifier in October 2016. If England top their group, they will play a third-placed team in the last 16 in Gelsenkirchen on June 30. However, if they finish second they will face the winners of Group A, which contains hosts Germany and also Scotland, in Dortmund. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bashundhara Kings took a massive stride towards qualifying for the knockout stage of the AFC Cup with a brilliant come-from-behind 2-1 win over visiting Maziya S&RC in their penultimate Group D fixture at Bashundhara Kings Arena today. Kings' Uzbekistani defender Boburbek Yuldashow's header in the 80th minute cancelled out Maziya's Regan Obeng's 10-minute goal. Brazilian midfielder Miguel Ferreira then struck a stunning winner with a brilliant chip that evaded goalkeeper's outstretched hands and nestled into the top left corner of the goalpost in the 88th minute. The charges of Oscar Bruzon now just need a win over hosts Odisha FC on December 11 to qualify for the zonal semifinals for the first time in their history and become the second Bangladeshi club to do so after Abahani in 2019. The win helped the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) champions maintain their lead in the four-team group with 10 points from five games while Maziya sit bottom of the table with three points from the same number of games. With the win, the Kings also maintained their unbeaten run at the Kings arena in both international and domestic competitions. The Kings were without their Brazilian captain Robson Da Silva, who was out injured, and looked short of confidence in the final third. The hosts got a couple of chances to score within the first seven minutes but Nigerian Mfun Sunday Udoh and Brazilian Dorielton Gomes squandered them. Maziya then took the lead against the run of play in the 10th minute, courtesy of a fumble from goalkeeper Mehdi Hasan Srabon. The rookie goalkeeper mistakenly passed the ball to Maziya's Vojislav Balabanonvic inside the box, whose shot got blocked by defender Boburbek Yuldashow. But the ricochet took the ball straight to Maziya's Ghanaian midfielder Regan Obeng, who easily fired the ball home. The Kings looked rattled after conceding the lead and Maziya kept creating chances before the break. But for the fourth straight match in the AFC Cup, the Kings bounced back after conceding a goal in the first half. Udoh came close on a few occasions to level the score while Bishwanath Ghosh rescued Kings from being killed off the match with a timely tackle on Hamza Mohamed in the 48th minute. With just 10 minutes of regular time to go, Sheikh Morsalin, who came in as a substitute in the 68th minute, whipped the ball inside the box from a corner kick which Yuldashow headed home. Miguel, who had scored against Mohun Bagan and Odisha FC, hit the winning goal with a chip from 30 yards out, as thousands of home fans in the stands erupted into celebration.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Premier League champions Bashundhara Kings would look to get their AFC Cup campaign back on track when they host Odisha FC of India in their first-ever international club match at the home venue. The match will get underway at the Bashundhara Kings Arena at 6:00pm. Having lost their opening match 3-1 away to Maziya S&RC – the first-ever defeat against a Maldivian club for the Bangladeshi giants, Kings know a defeat would diminish their hope of qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time great deal. Coach Oscar Bruzon, at the pre-match press conference, said the team has studied the opposition hard to get the best result in this crucial fixture. ""We have never lost two matches (in AFC Cup). We have never lost at home (in domestic football). So this will be a great opportunity for us to show our reaction,"" the Spaniard said. ""We had lot of expectations ahead of the Maziya game, but our preparation was not great. Now we are back and we have to give our best. We don't have any excuses now,"" Bruzon said, Like Kings, Odisha FC are also coming into the match on the back of a big defeat. They lost their opening match at home against Mohun Bagan 4-0, however, they have since some form following that defeat, with a 2-0 win against Chennaiyin FC in their opening fixture of the Indian Super League before drawing 2-2 against Mumbai City FC last week. Showing utmost respect to the opposition, Bruzon said that this match would be a do-or-die affair for both teams. ""Odisha are a new club like us. They won the Super Cup last season and made a good start this season. They have a top coach and important players in key positions. I think small aspects can make the difference tomorrow. ""This is a do-or-die affair for both teams because whoever loses this match will have their chances diminished,"" added Bruzon. Captain Robson Robinho echoed the coach's sentiment, saying: ""It's good that we will be playing at home, in front of our own crowd. We will do everything that we need to do to win this match and stay alive in this competition."" Odisha FC coach Sergio Lobera was excited about the challenge of facing Bashundhara Kings. ""We are excited about this game and are ready for this challenge. We are going to play against a good team. Most of all, we are excited to play in this competition as it means a lot for us as a club to represent not only our club but India as well. Hopefully, we can get a good result,"" the Spaniard said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bashundhara Kings finally managed to down Mohun Bagan SG in the AFC Cup by handing a come-from-behind 2-1 defeat to the Indian outfit in their crucial Group D encounter at Bashundhara Kings Arena on Tuesday. Brazilian duo Miguel Ferreira and Robson Da Silva struck one goal apiece after Liston Colaco provided Mohun Bagan a lead in the match in which Kings put up a much-improved performance compared to their away match two weeks ago. The maiden win over Mohun Bagan also pushed the Bangladesh Premier League champions on the top of the table alongside the visitors, both on equal seven points each from four matches. Kings, however, sit ahead of Bagan because of their home win which followed a 2-2 draw in the away fixture. Kings took to their familiar ground in front of an almost full-house home crowd, knowing that only a win could provide them a hope of getting out of the group stage for the first time following previous two failed attempts. The triumph over Mohun Bagan also gave Kings some moments to celebrate as they remained unbeaten at their home ground in the domestic and international fixtures. Kings tasted back-to-back victory in the AFC Cup fixture, with the first one coming against Odisha FC last month. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh national football team also remained unbeaten at this ground with two draws against Afghanistan and a win over Maldives. The charges of Spanish Oscar Bruzon got off to sparkling start under the floodlight as Dorielton Gomes came close to separate both sides in the seventh minute after being set up by Miguel, but Bagan goalkeeper Vishal Kaith cleared the Miguel forward pass before the Brazilian forward threatened. Kings kept penetrating the Mohun Bagan defence, with Vishal gripping a low shot from Dorielton in the eighth minute before being to be lucky in the 13rd minute as the Mohun Bagan goalkeeper could not reach a Robson curling shot that missed the far post narrowly. Mohun Bagan then took the lead against the run of play as Jason Cumming tried to the near post from the left side and Kings' inexperienced goalkeeper Mehdi Hasan Srabon slipped his grip and unmarked Liston drove the rebounder home easily to stun Kings, who had also conceded lead in previous three matches. However, Kings grew in confidence to come back strong and apply constant pressure before levelling the margin in the 44th minute. Charles Didier played Miguel with a square-pass on the top of the box from the right side and the Brazilian midfielder made space for his favourite left foot before letting loose a powerful shot past goalkeeper Vishal and sent the home crowd in raptures. Miguel then was denied by goalkeeper Vishal in the stoppage time of the first half before Robson saw his trademark curling shot on the left-hand box come off the far post in the 51st minute. He was also denied by woodwork in the away match. Getting rid of the Kings pressure, Mohun Bagan also threatened with better ball possession and penetration but Kings' young goalkeeper Srabon stood tall to thwart two efforts from the visitors. Kings soon managed to wake up from their brief slumber and cashed in a nice move from the right flank with Didier playing unimpressive Dorielton inside the box. Dorielton then cut it back for unmarked Robson who then made space to hammer a low right-footed drive into the near post in the 80th minute to provide Kings a deserved victory over Mohun Bagan. Bashundhara Kings will host Maziya SRC on November 27 before traveling to India to play their last match against Odisha FC on December 11. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Club Eagles of Maldives reached Sylhet yesterday, three days before their official arrival, to play the in a preliminary fixture of the AFC Cup against Abahani later this week. It will be the second AFC Cup appearance for Maldivian outfit, who got a walkover against Abahani in 2021 centring a dilemma over the venue, following their victory over Thimphu City of Bhutan in the Preliminary Round-1 match. Abahani, who failed to cross the preliminary or play-off hurdles in the last three editions, either fell to Indian or Maldivian clubs since qualifying for the zonal semifinals in 2019. Club Eagles, who have five foreign players in their roster, are expected to start their training today at Sylhet BKSP ground while Abahani will have their first training in Sylhet on August 14. The match will be played at Sylhet District Stadium on August 16. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Premier League champions Bashundhara Kings are all set to leave the country for United Arab Emirates this morning to take part in their maiden AFC Champions League appearance. An approximately 50-member contingent with six foreign players – Robson Da Silva, Dorielton Gomes, Miguel Figueira, Asror Gafurov, Shokhrukhbek Kholmatov, Boburbek Yuldashov and Charles Didier – along with new local signings including Mohammad Ibrahim, Mojibur Rahman Jonny and Aminur Rahman Sajib – will play their match against Sharjah FC on August 15 at the Sharjah Stadium. If the four-time Bangladesh Premier League winners can beat Sharjah FC, they will take on Iranian outfit Tractor FC in the play-off stage on August 22 in bid to get into the group stage of the competition. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bashundhara Kings coach Oscar Bruzon warned that nothing has been done after his team came from behind to defeat visiting Maziya S&RC 2-1 in their penultimate Group D match of the AFC Cup at Dhaka's Bashundhara Kings Arena on Monday. With back-to-back victories, the Bangladesh Premier League champions lead the four-team table with 10 points from five games and are in pole position to progress into the zonal semifinals of the competition as the second-ever Bangladeshi team after Abahani. Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan, on seven points, and Odisha FC, on six points, were yet to play their group match when Bruzon talked to reporters at the post-match meet. Bruzon did not want the game between Mohun Bagan and Odisha to end in a draw in Kolkata. ""Good thing we are still keeping the top spot. Let's wait for the results. I am sure that you are going to ask about the result of the other game [between Mohun Bagan and Odisha] and I will anticipate what we don't want is a draw,"" Bruzon said at the post-match conference at the Kings arena. ""If there is a draw, there is also a possibility that we can finish third after the next match [against Odisha FC on December 11]. So we are in a privileged position but nothing has been done."" Bruzon would be pleased that the game ended 5-2 in Odisha's favour, meaning Kings have to avoid a defeat against Odisha to become group champions. The Spaniard thanked the full-house crowd for backing Kings throughout the game. However, conceding the lead in every match in this competition so far has Bruzon worried. ""First of all, without our home crowd, this comeback won't be possible. So I want to thank all supporters for creating such an atmosphere here in the arena that has been very positive for our players,"" Bruzon said. ""Secondly, unfortunately in five AFC games, we always conceded a goal first and then we needed to come back with all our heart and change the initial plan to do a comeback. Good that it is working very well but we cannot continue [producing such comebacks]."" Bruzon was upset at one stage as his charges kept failing to convert goal-scoring chances. ""The game was very difficult, especially in the first half. Then in the second half we asked our players to play more vertically, try to avoid the central areas where Maziya were accumulating a lot of the players, and go more for crosses. ""I was upset that, again, we created more than 10 open and clear chances and it has been very difficult for us to convert the goals,"" said Bruzon, adding that he was confident to win the match if his charges could level the margin. ""It is true that in the minute 70 of the game, I saw a very dark cloud over Bashundhara Kings Arena and it was really difficult because we were creating a lot but could not take them home. ""The first goal was the game changer and I was sure that we would get the second goal once we got the first goal.""   আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Having undergone a recovery session on Wednesday, Bangladesh national team returned to a full-fledged training session at the practice ground of the Bashundhara Sports Complex ahead of two FIFA friendlies against Afghanistan. The men in red and green and Afghanistan face off on September 4 at the Bashundhara Kings arena before playing the second game three days later at the same venue. Although head coach Javier Cabrera began preparations for two FIFA friendly matches against Afghanistan in the third week of last month, he did not get his full squad as the players of Bashundhara Kings and Abahani joined the camp on Sept 25 and 27, respectively. Captain Jamal Bhuiyan was the last player to join the camp following his engagement with Sol de Mayo in Argentina's third division football league. ""Afghanistan have been a strong team as most of their players play in Europe. They are 30 to 35 places ahead of Bangladesh [in FIFA ranking], so they are strong, I think,"" Jamal told reporters following yesterday's training. ""However, we have the home ground advantage. We have to keep the spirit we showed in the SAFF Championship. I think we can produce a good result,"" said the 34-year-old midfielder, adding that he was happy to join training after returning home from Argentina. Jamal shared his experience of playing in Argentina as the captain of Sol de Mayo. ""I was surprised [to get the captaincy] there. The club president gave me the captain's armband, so I was happy. First of all, they helped me a lot and I liked it. Playing style and people have been different there and it has overall been a good experience,"" Jamal said. ""Everything like food, weather is different there. It is now a chilly winter in Argentina and I am now adapting to the conditions here."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh football team's head coach Javier Cabrera said the team would look to continue the performance of the SAFF Championship in the upcoming fixtures this year, with the team scheduled to appear in a number of assignments. The Spaniard, who led Bangladesh to a first semifinal in the regional event for the first time in 14 years only to lose the last-four battle against Kuwait in extra time, said he was disappointed of the end result but proud of the performance from the charges. ""We're very satisfied with what we have seen. We have seen consistency which is the main issue we always talk about. We always perform in one game or two games but then in the third game or fourth game we always used to drop. This time we have been able to perform in five games in a row. The message is same from everyone that we have to keep this, we have to maintain this level in the next months,"" the 38-year-old coach told reporters following a meeting with Bangladesh Football Federation president Kazi Salahuddin at his office today. The Spaniard said Salahuddin was of the same opinion, even though much of their discussion centred around the future rather than the past. Bangladesh are scheduled to participate in the first round of World Cup Qualifiers in October while the Olympic team will play in the Asian Games in September. There is also a FIFA window in November, which Bangladesh would look to avail. ""He's (Salahuddin) always been very supportive of us. He's very proud of the team, but the idea is to look forward. The meeting was more about SAFF than about how we could continue and how we are going to prepare for the rest of the year,"" said Cabrera. Cabrera also felt the fightback against Maldives, where Bangladesh went a goal down before winning 3-1, was the turning point for his side in the event. ""Maldives match was the one that probably decided what was going to happen,"" Cabrera opined. ""We knew that we had to win that match; if we didn't win against Maldives, things would have been very very different. That was probably the game that changed everything. Psychologically the team felt very strong."" The Spaniard also felt his team deserved more from the heartbreaking extra-time defeat against Kuwait in the semifinals. ""The Kuwait game was absolutely fantastic performance. After 90 minutes it was 0-0 against a team of huge level. I'm not upset. We do believe that we could have achieved the final. It was a total 50-50 game or even we were deserving more. Not upset but disappointed. But I'm proud,"" Cabrera concluded. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Before the start of the crucial match against Bhutan in SAFF Championship, the Bangladesh dugout was vibrant, excited and motivated with the bench-players and coaching staff shaking hands with each other, unlike the previous two matches against Lebanon and Maldives. With Bangladesh needing only a point against Bhutan to make it to the semifinals for the first time in 14 years, the excitement and euphoria all but evaporated after Bhutan had taken an early lead with a lightening performance. However, the men in red and green bounced back strongly to go for the lemon break with a 3-1 lead, thanks to goals from Rakib Hossain and Sheikh Morsalin. As the second half resumed and progressed, Rakib and midfielder Mohammad Sohel Rana, being substituted, watched the match from the gallery and screamed loudly for their on-field players to stop rampant Bhutan, who kept pressing to reduce the margin throughout the second half. ""People did not believe that we could qualify for the semifinals but we have done it. It is a good feeling that we will play in the semifinals. We will celebrate it today and then think of the match against Kuwait,"" captain Jamal Bhuiyan said at the mixed zone. ""Overall, we played well in the last three matches and we want to perform even better in the coming days,"" added Jamal. Defender Tapu Barman saw the qualification as a positive thing for Bangladesh football. ""This achievement is the outcome of hard work because we have been working as a team. I think staying together has been an important factor, which is why we have qualified for the semifinals. We all are really happy with this achievement,"" Tapu said, adding that all the players are tired after playing three matches actually eight days and that they did not celebrate their achievement at the dressing room. ""We want to celebrate it by winning the semifinal,"" said the experienced defender. ""We made the semifinals what we could not do in last 14 years. I am really happy to be a member of this squad. I think we will perform better in the semifinal because everyone is growing in confidence match by match,"" said Mohammad Sohel. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh had faced harsh criticism after poor performances in twin friendlies against an amateur-heavy Seychelles team in March and that negativity continued following a dismal performance against Cambodia in a friendly in June. Interestingly, the criticism came despite the men in red and green posting two victories. They defeated Seychelles 1-0 before losing by the same scoreline and then beat Cambodia 1-0. But even in victory, Javier Cabrera's team could hardly hold on to the ball, making erratic passes or taking loose touches to cede possession. Playing a possession-based game appeared a pipe dream given the showings, despite the fact that Cabrera's charges had shown signs of improvement and their fighting character in the AFC Asian Cup Qualifiers in Malaysia last year. That attitude had gone missing for Bangladesh's next five matches until the team started showing those characteristics afresh in the ongoing SAFF Championship. Speaking about what made the transformation possible, captain Jamal Bhuiyan said: ""We worked on those areas (build-up, attack, maintaining possession) and fine-tuned those things. The players also discussed which style would be suitable for us before sharing it with the coach. We believe the players will get tired if we always play on the counter-attack,"" said Jamal, who is playing in his fifth SAFF Championship. ""The coach also wants possession and a build-up game, but he prefers counter-attacking football. But we expressed our desire to the coach, believing we would get more chances if we play a possession-based game. And we are doing that now,"" Jamal continued, ""If you compare our recent performance to the matches against Seychelles, we are more flexible than we were in those games because we had been static in our own positions then. We could not move from our position as per the directives. But this time around, we were given more freedom to move to other places. That's why Bishwanath Ghosh went up front to help Sheikh Morsalin score the third goal."" Goalkeeper Anisur Rahman Zico echoed Jamal's sentiments about the team's transformation from a gritty defensive team to a build-up-focused unit. ""We have been together for a long time and the coach has been trying to play a build-up game. We tried it against Lebanon but could not do well because of their press. So we were forced to play long balls even though we planned to attack by building up from behind,"" Zico said, opining that they could not perform well against Seychelles and Cambodia because both teams pressed till the last minute. Assistant coach Hasan Al Mamun, who has been with Cabrera since the start of the last year, said the Spaniard's plan, methodology and execution had helped Bangladesh put up good performances against Lebanon and Maldives. ""Since Cabrera took over, he was planning to form a squad with a mix of experienced and young players. He placed a lot of emphasis on scouting players over the past 15 months,"" Hasan said, adding that younger players also had an impact on performance. ""You know there are a lot of young players in the squad such as Isa Faysal, Rafiqul Islam and Morsalin. They are playing their first international tournament while Md Ridoy, Mojibur Rahman Jonny and Mohammad Sohel Rana are also fresh players. If you look at the profile of these players, they have less experience in international matches. It was not easy to come back against Maldives with a team that features players with that sort of profile,"" Hasan, who was Bangladesh's stand-in captain during the 2003 SAFF Championship triumph, concluded. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Part-time off-spinner Glenn Phillips took four wickets as Bangladesh were reduced to 310 for nine at the end of the first day of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Phillips, who has a reputation of being a partnership-breaker in white-ball format, showed his prowess with the red ball too as he took the key wickets of Mominul Haque, Najmul Hossain Shanto, debutant Shahadat Hossain and wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan. Opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy top-scored with 86 runs while a number of batters got into 20s and 30s but could not kick on from there. On a pitch which assisted some turn for the spinners, Phillips was the most successful, giving away 53 runs in 16 overs while the two specialist spinners -- Azaz Patel and Ish Sodhi -- shared three wickets, Taijul Islam (8) and Shoriful islam (13) were at the crease at stumps as poor light ended the day's play after 85 overs. Debutant Shahadat departs for 24 Debutant Shahadat Hossain fell to an innocuous delivery from part-time spinner Glenn Phillips after negotiating 54 deliveries. The right-handed middle-order batter scored 24 before chipping an easy catch to short midwicket while advancing to the ball and trying to work it on the leg-side. The dismissal left Bangladesh 261 for seven, exposing the tail with Nurul Hasan the only recognised batter left. Bangladesh see themselves in a precarious position as the Tigers lost crucial wickets of Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz after resumption following the Tea break on Day 1 of their first Test against New Zealand at the Sylhet International Stadium today. At the end of 70 overs, Bangladesh are 243 for six with debutant Shahadat Hossain unbeaten on 17 off 41 and wicketkeeper-batter Nurul Hasan living dangerously -- he edged out two Kyle Jamieson deliveries soon after coming on to the crease -- not out on 10 off six. Mushfiqur was the first to fall in the final session of the day when the experienced campaigner threw his wicket away by charging Ajaz Patel. However, Mushfiqur could not clear the field, presenting a rather easy catch to Kane Williamson at deep mid-off. Miraz and debutant Shahadat started to build a partnership before the former was caught in two minds while playing a Kyle Jamieson delivery. Miraz tried to check his attempted pull shot and got a top edge, giving a simple catch to the first slip. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Australia skipper Pat Cummins believes Saturday's World Cup clash with New Zealand will be a battle between ""mates"" as the push for semi-final places enters a critical phase. Five-time champions Australia are back on track for a last-four spot having won three matches on the trot after an unimpressive start which saw them lose their first two games. New Zealand, runners-up in the last two World Cups, have the better record so far with four wins from five games. Australia, however, have the upper hand when it comes to clashes at World Cups over the years, winning eight of the 11 match-ups. ""I think most of the Kiwis are pretty placid and we're pretty similar,"" said Cummins on Friday on the eve of the game taking place in the Himalayan venue of Dharamshala. ""We've played a lot of cricket with these guys and some of them are really good mates. If anything, it makes you want to beat your mates even more. It will be intense out there."" In 2015, New Zealand edged a low-scoring group game by one wicket in Auckland before Australia gained revenge with a seven-wicket stroll in the final. Mitchell Starc, David Warner, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith and Josh Hazlewood are all survivors from the 2015 final. Cummins played in the group game. Current New Zealand squad members Kane Williamson, Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Tim Southee also played that final. ""It always seems like there's great contests. And on a personal note, as well, we know a lot of the New Zealand guys, we have played a lot against them and with them. So, it's always good fun,"" added Cummins. Cummins said he was delighted by Australia over-coming early losses at this World Cup to India and South Africa. They have since seen off Sri Lanka, Pakistan and then the Netherlands by a huge 309 runs. ""I think in the first two games not only did we not win, but I think we didn't really nail the style that we wanted to play,"" said the captain. ""I think in the last few games you've seen us be a bit more aggressive - batting and bowling."" Most of the aggression in the rout of the Dutch came from Glenn Maxwell who hit the fastest World Cup century off just 40 balls in New Delhi on Wednesday. Cummins shared a 103-run partnership with Maxwell, contributing only eight runs. ""Yeah, that was just insane the other night,"" said Cummins. ""I was lucky to be down at the other end, see it first-hand, the creativity that he seems to have, to find boundaries in just different spots, just incredible. He's a superstar."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. “The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That’s why we as a nation didn’t perform well,” Akram said A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company’s ball. Please, mend your ways.” ICC Head of Events Chris Tetley said the one-day international (ODI) tournament had been a ""great success."" Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia’s World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- “It's a lot better than seeing the World Cup on the couch at home,” said Travis Head as a smile crept across his face. Cricket-obsessed India was left grappling for answers Monday after the team's devastating defeat to Australia in the final of their home World Cup extended a drought in global tournaments. The issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped. ""I think that's been almost faultless, to be honest,” Ponting told Sky Sports after the match. Leading run scorer Virat Kohli — who was named player of the tournament — captain Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah and top wicket-taker Mohammed Shami were all included in the team. “It’s tough to watch boys like this,” Dravid told the media after his team’s heartbreaking six-wicket loss to Australia in the final. Rahul was India’s top scorer in the final with 67 runs but it took the batter 107 balls to score those runs.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents. Pakistan denies this and accuses India of violating the rights of Kashmir's Muslim people, a charge India rejects. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

With the showpiece event in the rearview mirror, The Daily Star Sports looks at 13 moments that mesmerised the fans in the past 46 days. Five key moments from the 2023 Cricket World Cup final on Sunday as Australia defeated India by six wickets: Wearing a face mask in the colours of the Palestinian flag, and a T-shirt with the slogan ""Stop Bombing Palestine"", the unnamed young protester ran onto the pitch in the 132,000-seat mega-stadium in India's western city of Ahmedabad. This is the longest boundary-less sequence (off the bat) for any team other than the Netherlands in this World Cup India posted 240 runs after being sent into bat first Drivers honked at fans blocking roads, shouting slogans and bargaining with roadside hawkers hours before the Sunday afternoon finale between the cricket-crazy hosts and the game's traditional powerhouse Australia. ""India are so powerful in their own conditions that I would say they would win this final 95 times out of 100,"" Broad wrote in his column for Daily Mail. The hosts take on Australia in the final in Ahmedabad on Sunday with Shami on top of the tournament bowling chart, taking 23 wickets in six matches After 150 ODIs involving the two sides, Australia earned 83 victories against India's 57. In World Cups, Australia lead India 8-5 after 13 games.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Taijul Islam completed a 10-wicket-haul as Bangladesh brought up their maiden home Test victory over New Zealand, defeating the Kiwis by 150 runs on the fifth day of the first Test at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Taijul, who had claimed four wickets in the first innings, hit the final nail on New Zealand's coffin on the day, by getting Ish Sodhi (22) caught at silly point to bowl out the visitors for 181. Taijul took two of the three remaining wickets on the day while Nayeem Hasan claimed the other. Earlier, Bangladesh conceded a seven-run lead in the first innings. Stand-in skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto's century and a couple of fifties from Mushfiqur Rahim and Mehedi Hasan Miraz helped the Tigers set a daunting 332-run target. Bangladesh had New Zealand on the ropes by the end of the fourth day when they reduced them to 113-7. It took the hosts less than 90 minutes in the morning session to complete the victory. With the result, Bangladesh have started the third cycle of the ICC Test Championship with a victory. This is also their second ever win in the competition, the previous one coming in the second cycle against the same opponents in Mount Maunganui in 2021. Bangladesh also take a 1-0 lead in the two-Test series with the win. The next Test will be played in Dhaka, starting on December 6. Bangladesh need three wickets on Day five to win Sylhet Test Taijul Islam completed his 12th five-wicket haul in Tests by ending the counter-attacking knock from Tim Southee as Bangladesh are now just one wicket away from winning the first Test on Day five at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. Southee, who made 34 off 24 balls, tried to pull a short delivery from Taijul but could only hit it as far as to Zakir Hasan. Bangladesh now need just one wicket to win their maiden home Test against New Zealand Mitchell departs, Bangladesh sensing victory Nayeem Hasan ended Daryl Mitchell's resistance on 58 as Bangladesh are now two wickets away from winning the Sylhet Test today.

"A sharp turning delivery from Ajaz Patel brought an end to Zakir Hasan's innings in the morning session of Day one of the Sylhet Test between Bangladesh and New Zealand today, a sign of things to come later in the match. Batting first, Bangladesh openers Zakir and Mahmudul Hasan Joy did well to negate New Zealand pacers Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson in the initial overs. After the seamers failed to bring the breakthrough, skipper Southee handed the ball to left-arm spinner Ajaz, who broke the opening stand on 39 in his fourth over. The ball pitched on around the fifth stump line, then turned back sharply to crash into Zakir's off stump, ending his innings on 12 off 42 balls. Najmul Hossain Shanto, Bangladesh's skipper in the match, has joined Joy in the middle. Shanto took the attack to Ajaz in his following over, hitting him for a four and a six as Bangladesh reached 50-1 after 15 overs. Joy is unbeaten on 19 while Shanto is batting on 10. Bangladesh have gone with three spinners and just the lone pacer in their eleven.

"Veteran opener David Warner kept his spot in Australia's squad announced Sunday to face Pakistan in the first Test this month for what is expected to be his farewell series. Warner was in scintillating white ball form at the recent World Cup, but he has scored just one Test century since early 2020 and averages only 28 since the 2019-2020 summer. It has sparked questions about whether he should retain his place at the top of the order alongside Usman Khawaja, with the likes of Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris and Matt Renshaw knocking on the door. That trio will all play for the Prime Minister's XI against Pakistan in a four-day red ball warm-up this week in Canberra, widely seen as an audition for Warner's job. ""This group, led by Pat Cummins, has built a strong resume over an extended period,"" chairman of selectors George Bailey said of the squad, which was named only for the Perth Test. ""We believe they have earned the opportunity to start in our first home Test match at the beginning of the new World Test Championship cycle."" Australia open the three-Test series in Perth on December 14, before the traditional Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, then Sydney, beginning January 3. Warner, 37, has indicated he plans to quit the five-day game after the Test at his home Sydney Cricket Ground, but continue in white ball cricket. Australia also have Tests against the West Indies later in January at Adelaide and Brisbane. ""As ever, there will be opportunities in the short- to medium-term to break into this squad,"" said Bailey. ""We look forward to seeing the continued strong performances from players who have been performing domestically, many of whom will get a tremendous opportunity in the PM's XI fixture against Pakistan later this week."" The only change for Perth from the team that started Australia's last Test against England at the Oval in July is likely to be the return of fit-again spinner Nathan Lyon in place of Todd Murphy, who did not make the squad. Lyon has 496 Test wickets and is on the verge of joining just seven other Test bowlers to breach the 500-mark, including fellow spin kings Muttiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne and Anil Kumble. Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood are again set to spearhead the pace attack with Scott Boland and firebrand Lance Morris -- on the comeback from a back stress injury -- waiting in the wings. All-rounder Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green were both included in the 14-man squad, but Marsh has moved ahead in the pecking order.

"Glenn Maxwell is still feeling the effects of his stunning World Cup double century and could now miss Australia's final group match against Bangladesh in Pune on Saturday. Australia will also look at calling up fast bowler Sean Abbott in a bid to rest one of their frontline pace trio, given captain Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood have featured in all eight matches so far in the tournament. The Bangladesh game is a 'dead' fixture for Australia, given they have already qualified for the semi-finals after Maxwell's astounding innings ensured they defeated Afghanistan by three wickets, having collapsed to 91-7 chasing 292, in Mumbai on Tuesday. Five-time champions Australia are now set to play South Africa in a Kolkata semi-final on Thursday, having won six games in a row after starting the tournament with two defeats. ""He's definitely been in full recovery mode the last few days,"" Australia assistant coach Daniel Vettori said of Maxwell. ""We all saw the effects of the innings and in particular the heat, so I think today (Friday) is a big day,"" the former New Zealand captain added. ""Obviously, we've had a couple of days off, so there's been no training. He's not here today but we'll just see how he feels as the day continues."" Maxwell, while completing his 147th run, suffered severe cramp in both legs and then underwent a back spasm as he collapsed to the turf at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Yet despite being then barely able to move in his crease, he still went on to make 201 not out off just 128 balls. The 35-year-old all-rounder struck 21 fours, and secured both victory and his double century with a tenth six. Australia are set to leave a decision on whether to play Maxwell against Bangladesh until shortly before the game, with star batsman Steve Smith set to be recalled following a bout of vertigo. If Maxwell is omitted and Smith included, that would spare Australia's selectors from deciding if they had to drop either batsman Marnus Labuschagne or all-rounder Marcus Stoinis. Meanwhile, Vettori said the 31-year-old Abbott had a chance of a World Cup debut. ""To try to get those three fast bowlers (Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood) through nine games and in a short period of time, we always presumed that would be a tough challenge,"" said Vettori. ""So Sean was always in the picture as a potential replacement for one of them...It's just weighing up how everyone's come through these last few days."" Although little rests on the outcome of Saturday's match, Vettori added Australia were still keen to leapfrog South Africa into second place in the standings. ""I think the home dressing room at (Kolkata's) Eden Gardens is better than the away one, so we want second place so we can get in that dressing room,"" he said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Pakistan bowling coach Morne Morkel on Saturday said the whole team will ""put their arms around"" Usama Mir after his dropped catch opened the doors for Australia to clinch a crucial World Cup victory. Leg-spinner Mir, playing in his first match of the tournament, spilled an easy-looking catch which would have seen the back of David Warner in the fifth over of Friday's game bowled by Shaheen Shah Afridi. At the time Warner was on just 10 -- he went onto make 163, hitting nine sixes and 14 boundaries to propel Australia to an imposing 367-9. Warner and Mitchell Marsh (121) put on 259 for the opening wicket. Pakistan lost their way with a middle-order collapse and were bowled out for 305 in 45.3 overs to lose by 62 runs. ""Luckily the team atmosphere is very strong and everybody in that dressing room will put their arms around Usama and support him,"" said former South Africa fast bowler Morkel. ""It was a dropped catch. Anybody can drop catches on any day, it's part of the game."" Mir, 27, was playing in only his ninth one-day international in Bengaluru on Friday after replacing fellow leg-spinner Shadab Khan. ""This is a big opportunity for Mir to learn and I am sure that he will overcome this,"" added Morkel. ""It is for us to support him in tough times. The character he has shown as a player is strong and I am sure he will get through it."" - 'It's brutal' - Morkel, who played 86 Tests, 117 ODIs and 44 T20Is in a distinguished South Africa career, admitted that the pressures of a World Cup can weigh on all players. ""This is a big stage and the margins are very small and at times it's brutal,"" said Morkel. ""As a youngster and as a quality player, playing the World Cup in India is a great experience for all."" Morkel praised Shaheen after the Pakistan strike bowler overcame the disappointment of seeing Warner dropped to go on and claim 5-54. ""He has shown character,"" said Morkel of Shaheen who had only four wickets in the first three games of the World Cup. ""I think at the start he wanted to make a big impact and maybe tried too hard,"" said Morkel. ""He changed his strategy a bit and bowled a hard length. At the back end he bowled so well."" He added: ""He's back in the wickets, he was down for four days with a viral infection and could hardly train. But to come out with a performance like that after just one training session was great."" After winning their opening games against the Netherlands and Sri Lanka, Pakistan have now lost two in a row with the Australia setback coming after they were completely outplayed by India last weekend. They are fifth in the 10-nation tournament with only the top four making the semi-finals. Morkel admitted that the absence from the World Cup through injury of pace bowler Naseem Shah had dented the team's fast bowling resources. ""Naseem is a very fast rising bowler. Fast bowlers hunt in pairs and I had Dale Steyn. Losing Naseem is one of the factors."" Morkel also backed Haris Rauf, the pace bowler who has eight wickets at the World Cup. Rauf claimed three against Australia but conceded 83 runs. ""Rauf gave a hundred per cent and I can't find fault,"" said Morkel. ""He had a tough first few overs and Australia were looking for 400. He and the others came back and stopped that."" sh/dj © Agence France-Presse আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has released the list of 21 cricketers under central contracts for the year 2023. Liton Kumar Das, Shakib Al Hasan, Taskin Ahmed and Mehdi Hasan Miraj have been kept under contract for all three formats. Youngsters like Zakir Hasan and Hasan Mahmud have come under contract for the first time. In the press release issued by the BCB on Saturday, there is no big surprise. Mushfiqur Rahim is on ODI and Test contract after retiring from T20s. Mahmudullah, who retired from Tests earlier, lost his place in the T20 team in the last World Cup. The former captain has been kept on ODI contract only. ODI captain Tamim Iqbal is also under contract for both versions. Right-arm pacer Hasan Mahmud was on rumored to be in central contract. He got the reward for his consistent performance last year. Opener Zakir, who scored a century on his Test debut last year, has been placed on a long-term contract. Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Shadman Islam dropped out to give him place. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Around hundred people, including men, women and children, were seen waiting yesterday outside the Grand Sylhet hotel located near the airport road, where Bangladesh cricket team had checked in for the ongoing T20I series against Afghanistan. Similar scenes were also witnessed inside the hotel premises as forty to fifty had been patiently waiting for a lifetime opportunity to snap a selfie with their heroes. Around 3pm, pacer Shoriful Islam -- who hit the winning runs for the Tigers as they clinched a dramatic two-wicket win over Afghanistan in the first T20I on Friday -- returned to the team hotel with his wife after a trip to Ratargul swamp forest, 26 km from the Sylhet city. Shoriful and teammates enjoyed a well-deserved day off, without official training or any media activity, yesterday. Half hour later, skipper Shakib Al Hasan, dressed in a white t-shirt, black trouser, and a cap, was seen heading out from the lobby. The star cricketer hopped in to a van and went out for a brief outing. The mood in the Tigers camp was relaxed at the team hotel. On the other hand, a contrasting atmosphere pervaded among the visitors as Rashid Khan and his troops spent time training at the Sylhet International Cricket stadium, focused on avoiding a series loss today. The crowd outside the hotel were unable to get a chance to see their beloved cricketers up close, but the craze and buzz in the northeastern region of the country remains at its peak; especially following a brilliant show from the home side. The current T20I series has been the talk of the town in Sylhet, where Bangladesh registered their first win in the shortest format after three outings here so far. Meanwhile, there were long queues outside the ticket booth of the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium (SICS) yesterday. The fans are again expected to flock in numbers to support the Tigers in the second T20I today. The atmosphere at the SICS was no short of electrifying on Friday. Around a twenty-thousand capacity crowd witnessed the game at the picturesque venue, while at least more than a thousand without tickets had hovered along the stadium's periphery. Since the Tigers do not get to play international cricket that often in Sylhet, the locals have voiced their demand of seeing more matches getting staged here in future. With a high demand for tickets and the subsequent overwhelming situations during matches, the authorities have to prepare to constantly stay on their toes to maintain a huge crowd outside the venue. The Bangladesh Cricket Board director and chairman of the women's wing department, Shafiul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, urged to have more matches in Sylhet in order to bring commonality among the hyper-enthusiastic fans in Sylhet. ""Since we don't get the opportunity to host more matches, the craze among the supporters skyrockets whenever there is a series in Sylhet. The capacity of the stadium is for around twenty-thousand spectators, and we distribute tickets up to eighteen-and-half thousand,"" said Nadel. ""Since we also have the grass bank, we try to release around two-thousand tickets for the security purpose. ""Considering the structure of the stadium premises, if you notice, there are so many open spaces from which the spectators who don't purchase tickets try to get in illegally. We are trying to stop them and also want more matches in order to bring some stability among the fans when it comes to their craze for cricket."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"As per Bangladesh's Asia Cup schedule, the Tigers will face Sri Lanka in their opening group match in Kandy, Sri Lanka, on August 31 and then will have to be in Pakistan's Lahore in two days to play Afghanistan. Bangladesh will be afforded chartered flights as they are one of the teams that will play matches both in Pakistan and Sri Lanka as per the hybrid model. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) cricket operations committee chairman Jalal Yunus talked to the media yesterday and said that the board is aware of this 'travelling issue'. ""Following our first game in Kandy, we have to leave for Lahore. It is what it is, and we can not do anything about it. It's [Asian Cricket Council] ACC's decision. ACC will be providing chartered flights to make the journey more comfortable. The arrangement will be for all the teams who have matches in two countries. It's ACC's responsibility. We, of course, want the flights to be from good organisations,"" Jalal informed the media yesterday. The tournament is set to test Bangladesh's mental agility in terms of coping with logistical challenges while focusing on the matches as well. Bangladesh, if they qualify for the Super Four stage, will get two days to prepare for their game against Pakistan on September 6. Then the team will have to hurry back to Colombo for their Super Four game on September 9, with Sri Lanka being the likely opponent. Following that game, the Tigers, however, would get some rest days before their last Super Four game, against India most likely, on September 15. ""Of course, it's a problem to travel this much. We all know that to take a flight, you have to be at the airport two hours beforehand with your luggage. There is the matter of jet lag as well. So, that will create a mental pressure. Pakistan is far away from Sri Lanka but we have to abide by the ACC's decision,"" he added. Bangladesh's issues are not only limited to logistical challenges. With ODI skipper Tamim Iqbal having unretired, the question mark over his fitness still remains. Tamim yesterday said in an interview to local news outlets that a lot of things from the fallout of the retirement saga will now depend on his meeting with the cricket operations committee chairman Jalal once he returns to the country. Jalal informed that Tamim wants to return to the country following his treatment in the UK by July 31, with the Asia Cup camp starting from July 29. ""Tamim will be going to London on the 26th. After his treatment there, a decision will be taken based on his condition. His plan is to return to the country by the 31st. The decision going forward will depend on his physical condition,"" Jalal said regarding Tamim. From the looks of the Emerging Asia Cup squad, where as many as six openers were lined up, the team management had been preparing for backup options for the opening slot. The performances of a few have already garnered attention of the team management and one or two players will be in the Asia Cup preliminary camp. ""Emerging squad players will be in the preliminary preparation camp. Many of them are doing well. One or two among them will be coming to the preliminary team but there is no certainty that they will make the best 15,"" Jalal added. The Bangla Tigers unit has also been undergoing camp in Chattogram but ultimately, Jalal informed that players getting the nod or being excluded will depend on the medical department as fitness takes precedence ahead of the World Cup. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan Papon said that he would discuss with Shakib Al Hasan which formats the cricketer wants to captain, following the declaration that Shakib will lead Bangladesh in the Asia Cup and World Cup – both in 50-over format. Shakib, already the captain of Test and T20 sides, has been handed this responsibility following Tamim Iqbal's stepping down due to injury. Papon, talking to reporters at his residence on Friday, said it would be tough for Shakib to continue captaining in three formats. ""I think it will be tough for him to captain in three formats. I can't say about this without discussing with him,"" Papon said. ""If he says he wants to captain in one format, then it's one thing. He might say he wants to captain in two formats, maybe in white ball or red ball. Then it's another thing. He might even say he's comfortable in captaining in three formats. So we want to discuss with him first and then take a decision through the board. ""But I think he might be under much pressure if he wants to captain in three formats given the amount of matches we have coming up,"" the board president opined. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Following a few days of non-activity at the BCB headquarters, yesterday's proceedings drew some attention from the media, especially due to the presence of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha. It was both Shakib and Hathurusingha's first visit to Mirpur since the World Cup debacle in India. Coach Hathurusingha, along with team director Khaled Mahmud, went to submit their World Cup reports. Hathurusingha and Shakib had a chat as well. ""He [Hathurusingha] had already handed over his report [on World Cup] via email. Since he and the team are departing for Sylhet today, he was here to discuss the team's plans,"" a BCB source close to the development told The Daily Star yesterday. Sources have confirmed that the report was delivered directly to BCB president Nazmul Hassan Papon. There had not been much discussion regarding the World Cup debacle yet and the BCB president's busy schedule due the upcoming national elections may have played a part in it. The head coach's continuity had been a major talking point following the World Cup and an upcoming board meeting will shed light on developments in that regard. ""The decision is left up to the board,"" one source said. Cricket operations chairman Jalal Yunus, however, said that any individual coach's continuity going forward cannot be commented upon at this moment. Shakib went to the BCB headquarters for the first time since suffering a finger injury on November 6 during Bangladesh's penultimate World Cup match against Sri Lanka, which ruled him out of the last game against Australia and also the home Test series against New Zealand. ""He (Shakib) came here so that we could change the dressing on his fractured finger,"" a member of BCB's medical department told The Daily Star. Having already been ruled out of the Test series at home against New Zealand, Shakib's availability for the upcoming tour of New Zealand remains a doubt. He is slated to undergo an X-ray on his left index finger in three weeks to assess the injury, but with the team scheduled to depart for New Zealand on the tentative date of December 11, team management sources have said that his availability remains doubtful. Meanwhile, the coaching staff's continuity for the Test series have also been under the spotlight from the World Cup. Pace bowling coach Allan Donald and performance analyst Shrinivas Chandrasekaran have already announced that they would not be continuing. Spin bowling coach Rangana Herath's contract comes to an end on November 30. BCB cricket operations sources claimed that the board would decide soon whether Herath's contract would be renewed while the rest of the coaching staff are expected to arrive before the series. Meanwhile, both New Zealand and Bangladesh teams would hold practice sessions in Sylhet today as preparations begin for the first Test. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"After missing out on the home Test series against New Zealand, Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is running the risk of missing December's tour to New Zealand where the Tigers will play three ODIs and three T20s. Shakib went to the BCB premises in Mirpur today for the first time since suffering a finger injury on November 6 during Bangladesh's penultimate World Cup match against Sri Lanka, which ruled him out of the last game against Australia and also the home Test series against New Zealand. Now as things stand, Shakib remains doubtful for Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand next month. ""He (Shakib) came here so that we could change the dressing on his fractured finger,"" a member of BCB's medical department told The Daily Star today. It was learnt that Shakib would have to undergo an X-ray on his left-index finger after three weeks when the bandage will be opened again. Bangladesh are expected to depart for New Zealand on December 11, and since his dressing is expected to be reopened on December 13 to assess his recovery, his participation for the tour is in doubt. A BCB source close to the team management replied by saying, 'let's see', when asked about Shakib's availability for the tour. Meanwhile, the BCB selection panel held a meeting at the BCB offices today. The Tigers will return to action following the World Cup with the Test series at home against the Kiwis, slated to begin in Sylhet on November 28. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"From aspirations of making it to their maiden semifinal to barely qualifying for the 2025 Champions Trophy with an eighth-placed finish, Bangladesh's World Cup dream has fluctuated as wildly as its tumultuous state of affairs. If looked closely, at the core of the fiasco, two entities could be found -- skipper Shakib Al Hasan and his enabler, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB). At 36, Shakib just wanted to play in what he said was going to be his World Cup swansong. He had clearly mentioned in a much-talked-about interview that he had no intention of leading the Tigers in the mega event and was only made to do so at the behest of the BCB. So, questions could be raised as to why BCB -- a board that always claims to prioritise long-term planning over anything else -- would send a team to the World Cup under someone who was reluctant to lead in the first place? Is it because there were no other suitable candidates to take the helm? If so, then that contradicts the long-stated claims of a rich pipeline and the depth of the national team's pool of players. While that is a part played by the country's cricketing governing body in the Tigers' recent slump, Shakib and the team management including head coach Chandika Hathurusingha only furthered the downward spiral. Hathurusingha could be inquired about how the bunch of players that had seen Bangladesh do decently in ODIs just months ago had lost their mojo and balance in the most crucial time while Shakib would have to justify his off-field antics more than his underwhelming on-field performances. Despite being forcibly burdened with the captaincy, expectations on Shakib were still very high, especially after his superhuman effort in the same tournament four years ago. Dealing with such pressure and cancelling out the outside noise has never been an issue for a champion cricketer like Shakib. In fact, followers of Bangladesh cricket know how he had made a pattern of covering up his off-field misdoings with immediate brilliance with the willow and the ball. But this time, things proved to be different. After being part of the chaotic process of team selection for the World Cup that saw Tamim Iqbal being left out at the last minute, Shakib only managed to drum up more controversy and almost no superhuman act on the field to cover it up. Shakib's trip to Dhaka for a few solo practice sessions with his mentor midway through the World Cup was followed by the Tigers hitting the nadir of their already abysmal campaign -- an 87-run thumping at the hands of associate member, the Netherlands, in a game where Shakib made five with the bat and scalped just a solitary wicket. Also, for the first time in a long while, Shakib even looked to have let the pressure get to him when he struggled for eight deliveries before finally opening his account in the game against Pakistan. Shakib's World Cup campaign ended with a player-of-the-match performance against Sri Lanka, but his overall 2023 World Cup figures of 186 runs at 26.57 average and nine wickets may be an outcome befitting the visible shift of focus Shakib's career has seen in the last few years. Since coming out of his ICC-sanctioned ban for failing to report corrupt approaches in 2020, Shakib has anything but stayed away from controversies. From having affiliations with betting sites, kicking stumps, arguing with on-field umpires, returning to the country for personal reasons in the middle of the Asia Cup 2023 in Sri Lanka to inaugurating jewellery shop of a fugitive criminal -- Shakib could not have made it more apparent about his priorities and reluctance to fall into line. Maybe Shakib had things clear in his mind long before his reflection on the matter came to the fore when he said in that interview, ""Would that [captaining Bangladesh in this World Cup] add any value to my career at this stage?"" Perhaps Shakib knew all along what he was taking the team into and only tried to deflect the blame in case things went south when he admitted to not being willing to be in the leadership role ahead of the World Cup. Shakib is used to evading the true repercussions of his antics, mostly by riding on the BCB's reluctance to do anything about those. It might not be any different for Shakib this time too but the same can not be said of Bangladesh cricket which will have to suffer the real consequences of always accommodating a reluctant performer. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Batsman Shahadat Hossain Dipu makes his Test debut as Bangladesh won the toss and opted to bat first against New Zealand in the first Test of the two-match series at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium today. The Tigers have gone with a spin-heavy attack with Mehedi Hasan Miraz, Nayeem Hasan and Taijul Islam in the eleven and Shoriful Islam as the lone pacer in the side. Wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan also returns to the Test team and he will be keeping the wickets in the absence of Liton Das, who is currently on leave for family reasons. The visitors, on the other hand, have three spin bowling options in their eleven in Ish Sodhi, Ajaz Patel and part-timer Glenn Philips. Rachin Ravindra, New Zealand's breakout star from the World Cup in India, hasn't been picked for the Test. Both teams will kick-start their campaigns in the 2023-25 cycle of the ICC World Test Championship with the match. Najmul Hossain Shanto is leading Bangladesh in place of injured Shakib Al Hasan.

"Former West Indies wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich has retired from international cricket and withdrawn from the squad for a one-day international series against England, the country's cricket board (CWI) said on Thursday. Dowrich this month earned a surprise recall to the West Indies squad, three years after he played his last Test and four years since he featured in his only ODI. The 32-year-old played in 35 Tests, scoring 1570 runs with a high score of 125 not out against Sri Lanka in 2018. He also had 85 catches and five stumpings as a wicketkeeper. ""We want to thank Shane for contribution when he played for West Indies. He is a disciplined, hard-working cricketer who always gave his utmost in front and behind the stumps,"" CWI Director of Cricket Miles Bascombe said. ""We respect his decision to retire and appreciate it is not an easy one to make. We wish him all the best as he steps away from the international stage."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh captain Najmul Hossain Shanto said his team are enjoying the victory, but knows that there would be criticism of his side if they do poorly in the next match. The 25-year-old, led Bangladesh to a first-ever home Test win against New Zealand in Sylhet on Saturday in what was his first assignment as the skipper in the red-ball format, said his and his team's focus is on 'maintaining the process and giving full commitment on the field ""Overall we played a very good match. I'm very happy to have won the first Test match as a captain,"" Shanto told reporters at the post-match press conference in Sylhet. ""We had the belief that we could win this match. I said that before the Test because I believed we could win. I think the belief was within everyone. ""The job is only half-done. Another match is left and it's not as if we will go there and win it too. We'll have to work for five more days for that victory."" Shanto has had opportunities in the past to captain in shorter formats but this was his first assignment in a Test match where his team were thought of as underdogs due to the absence of important players such as Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Taskin Ahmed and Ebadot Hossain. But Bangladesh dominated the former World Test Championship winners from in all departments and eventually won the match by 150 runs. Shanto feels there will be more expectation the next time around, especially as they travel to Dhaka for the second Test starting from December 6. ""I'm not too concerned about winning or losing. I feel if the process is maintained and if the commitment is there from the players, I'm fine. If those things are there, results will likely come out positive. ""There will be outside talk. Now [that we won], there will be a lot of good words said about us and then there will be criticism if we do poorly in another match. That is not in our control and we don't think about that either,"" said Shanto, who apart from showing excellent captaincy skills, scored a fine century in the second innings of the match. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Wednesday included the likes of Mominul Haque, Taijul Islam, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, and Anamul Haque as it announced the BCB XI squad for their upcoming tour of India this month. Led by Mohammad Mithun, the BCB XI are scheduled to play two four-dayers and three one-day matches against Ranji Trophy playing side Tamil Nadu State. The BCB XI squad will leave for Chennai on October 8 and will begin their series with the first four-day match at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on October 12. The second four-dayer will begin on October 19 while the three one-dayers are slated for October 27, 29, and 31, respectively. This series against India's Tamil Nadu side has been arranged by the BCB as an alternative following cancellation of the series against Afghanistan. This series will also offer match-practice for the likes of Mominul, Taijul, and other national Test players ahead of the Test series against India in December.  BCB XI Squad for four-day matches: Mohammad Mithun (c), Shadman Islam, Saif Hassan, Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Mominul Haque, Anamul Haque Bijoy, Tawhid Hridoy, Jaker Ali, Nayeem Hasan, Taijul Islam, Khaled Ahmed, Rejaur Rahman Raja, Mukidul Islam, Anamul Haque.

"For Bangladesh, things have been chaotic in Tests and T20Is both on and off the field lately. The Test and T20I sides have seen sudden change in leadership, with Mominul Haque and Mahmudullah Riyad being stripped of captaincy of the Test and T20Is respectively. But that did not see Tigers fare any better in these two formats, with the Shakib Al Hasan-led Test side suffering a humiliating 3-0 defeat in their recent-most Test series away to the West Indies in June while an inexperienced T20I side, under the leadership of Nurul Hasan Sohan, endured their first-ever bilateral T20I series defeat against Zimbabwe this week. Amid such mayhem, if Bangladesh cricket can find some sort of order and stability, at least on the field, it is in their preferred format of one-day cricket. The Tigers have been in tremendous form in the format lately, winning six of their last seven ODI series under the leadership of Tamim Iqbal. But Tamim still remained cautious ahead of their first match of the three-match ODI series, starting today at the Harare Sports Club. ""Considering the strengths of the two squads, we are definitely ahead of them. But in cricket, whichever team plays better on the day wins. Zimbabwe won the T20I series simply because they played better cricket than us. It's the same when it comes to the ODI series. We obviously want to beat them but for that we would have to bring our A-game. In their conditions, Zimbabwe are a dangerous team,"" Tamim said at the pre-match press conference yesterday. Bangladesh go into the series on the back of ODI series triumphs over South Africa and the West Indies. The Tamim-led side defeated the Proteas for the first-time ever in their own backyard back in March before whitewashing the West Indies in a three-match series last month. And Tamim remained adamant that the team would keep doing whatever had worked for them lately. ""We have to do whatever we have been doing in recent matches – that's the plan. We also have to rectify those things that we did not do right. Most importantly, we would need to follow the process so that we can come out as winners even from difficult situations,"" Tamim added. Tamim's long-term plan since taking the leadership role has always been surrounding the upcoming ODI World Cup next year in India. According to the left-handed opener, this series could be an opportunity for some of the youngsters in the squad to cement their places in the eleven ahead of the ODI World Cup. ""Apart from [Mahmudullah] Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim and I, it is a very young squad. There are one or two spots in the squad which have not been cemented yet. So, considering that, there is an opportunity for every young player to make their statement and get into the eleven,"" Tamim added. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batter Anamul Haque Bijoy revealed Bangladesh were shocked after hosts Zimbabwe chased a high target of 304 runs in the first match of the recently concluded three-match ODI series. Bangladesh left for Zimbabwe with the aim to play fearless cricket but after dismal performances saw the visitors lose both three-match T20I and ODI series, it seems the Tigers will return home laden with fear. Bangladesh bowlers finally showed some urgency in the just-concluded ODI series as the visitors picked a convincing 105-run victory against hosts Zimbabwe in the final and third ODI in Harare today. Bangladesh pacer Ebadot Hossain, scalped two wickets in his just the second over of his ODI debut as Zimbabwe stutter in chase of the total set by Bangladesh. Slow scoring rate, lack of firepower and inability to convert fifties into centuries once again cost Bangladesh as the Tigers posted a below-par total in the final and third ODI against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club today. Opener Anamul Haque Bijoy continued his good run of form, picking up his fifth ODI fifty in the third and final ODI against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club today. After a decent opening stand, Bangladesh lost three quick wickets to see themselves in a precarious situation in the third and final ODI against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club today. In their landmark 400th ODI, Bangladesh were asked to bat by hosts Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club today. Before the ongoing Zimbabwe tour, Bangladesh were flying high in the ODI format, with series wins away to South Africa and West Indies. But suddenly, after two successive defeats against a side ranked eight places below in space of just three days, the Tigers now seem to be in a disarray in their most preferred format. Since debuting on the international stage in 2013 through an ODI against Bangladesh in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza has demonstrated his fighting prowess, on and off the field, time and again. The 36-year-old, who is enjoying a phenomenal run of form of late, keeps scaling greater heights with each passing game at an age when most good quality cricketers go into decline. Raza shared his views about his and side's game, also how he views the current Bangladesh team and more, in an interview with The Daily Star's Ekush Tapader, the excerpts of which are as follows: It was a rather unusual yet a vital knock from Mahmudullah Riyad as the experienced cricketer played an unbeaten 80 off 84 balls to guide Bangladesh in posting a fighting total of 290 for nine against Zimbabwe in the second and series-saving ODI in Harare yesterday. Sikandar Raza's splendid second consecutive hundred, along with skipper Regis Chakabva's maiden ODI ton, led Zimbabwe to a five-wicket victory against Bangladesh in the second ODI in Harare yesterday, thereby sealing the three-match ODI series with a game in hand. It was the hosts' first ODI series win against Bangladesh after nine years. Sikandar Raza’s second ton in consecutive matches and skipper Regis Chakabva’s 75-ball 102, saw Zimbabwe clinch the second ODI by five wickets to clinch their first ODI series against Bangladesh since 2013. Mahmudullah Riyad scored his 26th ODI half-century as Bangladesh posted a challenging total of 290 for nine against Zimbabwe in the second ODI at the Harare Sports Club on Tuesday. Mahmudullah Riyad and Afif Hossain played contrasting knocks as Bangladesh looked to post a challenging total on the board in the second ODI against Zimbabwe in Harare on Tuesday. Bangladesh have lost the toss for the fifth time in five games on their tour to Zimbabwe. The Tigers, who lost the first ODI by five wickets, were asked to bat first by Zimbabwe captain Regis Chakabva in the second ODI in Harare on Tuesday. The best of players are known to crave the pressure of performing against the wind, when chips are down. On Friday, Sikandar Raza made audiences witness once again that pressure makes diamonds as his gem of a knock, a 109-ball 135, entered into Zimbabwe cricket folklore. Before the first ODI, Bangladesh skipper Tamim Iqbal was of the opinion that the Tigers were favourites going into the three-match series against Zimbabwe. But he did warn that Bangladesh would have to play their best cricket to beat the hosts. ","sports"
"Bangladesh wicketkeeper-batter Anamul Haque Bijoy revealed Bangladesh were shocked after hosts Zimbabwe chased a high target of 304 runs in the first match of the recently concluded three-match ODI series. The Tigers, who started the tour by losing the three-match T20I series, eventually went on to concede the ODI series against Zimbabwe after nine years. Bangladesh team returned home today empty-handed following a disappointing Zimbabwe tour. ""Obviously we were very shocked after the defeat in the first ODI. We were unable to perform according to our expectation,"" Bijoy told the media at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka today. ""Obviously we all felt bad and when we saw the second game also going in the same way, we were a bit nervous. I think this was the series where we were unable to give our hundred per cent."" Although Bijoy was unable to perform in the T20I series -- scoring 16 and 14 runs, respectively -- the right-handed batter made his mark on his return to the ODI format after three years. The 29-year-old made a comeback to the national team on the back of his world-record performance in the Dhaka Premier League earlier this year, where Bijoy tallied a whopping 1138 runs in 15 games at an average of 81.28; including nine fifties and three hundreds. Bijoy still had to wait for his ODI return despite being part of the squad in West Indies but he finally got a chance to prove his worth during his comeback game in the first ODI against Zimbabwe. However, Bijoy's 73 off 62 balls went in vain eventually as the Tigers lost the game by five wickets. He scored 20 and 70 in the following games and thus remained in contention for a place in the upcoming Asia Cup squad. ""Obviously it felt good to be back in the ODI side after a long time as I was very excited,"" Bijoy continued. ""I have worked really hard during this period and since I got an opportunity after three years I tried to utilise that and tried to do the process right. ""Obviously I would have felt better if my performance helped the team to win. It was not easy to beat Zimbabwe at their den as they played better cricket. We also made some mistakes which is the reason why we lost the series. I will try to continue to give my best in the coming days as well,"" Bijoy concluded.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh's top order batting meltdown has remained the biggest cause of concern for the team management and the latest batting failure meant the visitors had to suffer a convincing seven-wicket defeat against West Indies in the first Test of the two-match series in Antigua. Bangladesh became the first side in Test cricket's vast history to have six of their batters depart for naught in consecutive Tests as the Antigua Test saw the Tigers get bundled out for 103 in their first innings. The visitors continued their poor run in the second innings as well and were six down before fifty on the board, ultimately all out for 245. In their last five Tests, Bangladesh lost their top five batters inside fifty or less runs on five occasions. Now, after repeated batting malfunction, there are high chances the team management will come up with a few changes on the batting front for the second Test, scheduled to begin from June 24 in St Lucia. One of the likely ones could be Anamul Haque Bijoy, the wicketkeeper-batter who was initially included for the upcoming white-ball series against the Windies. Anamul was rewarded with a return to the national camp based on the brilliant run of form he displayed in the Dhaka Premier League (DPL)– a fifty-over competition -- earlier this year. Anamul's dreamlike season in the DPL saw him turn into a run machine. A staggering 1138 runs made him a world-record holder too as he beat Tom Moody's record of scoring 917 runs, which the Australian had set for Worcestershire in 1991. The wicketkeeper-batter, who opened the innings for Prime Bank in the DPL, had struck a total of three hundreds and nine fifties with a whopping average of 81.28, prompting the selectors to include him for the three-match ODI and three-match T20I series in the Caribbean. However, Anamul was also included in the Test side as the replacement of middle order batter Yasir Ali, who was ruled out after having sustained a back injury during the three-day practice game ahead of the Test series. ""Good to join the Test team after a long time. Since there are some days left before the second Test, I will try to prepare myself well,"" said Anamul, who played his last Test eight years back in 2014 against West Indies. ""And if I get an opportunity I will try to give my best. Looking forward to the second Test."" Now, it will be interesting to see if Anamul finds his way into the playing eleven in Saint Lucia. And even if he does, which position would he bat? There are high chances the right-hander may replace Najmul Hossain Shanto after the lefty had failed to make an impact at the crucial number three position in recent times.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon said that he will get to the bottom of the events that led to the team's disastrous showing in the ICC World Cup only after the BPL, following a meeting with Tamim Iqbal at his residence in Gulshan today. ""I told him [Tamim] whatever my decision is I will take it after the BPL,"" Papon told reporters after his meeting with the opener. ""After the election, when the BPL starts, all the players will be here, the coaching staff will also be here. In that time I can collect all information and then take the decision that will benefit our cricket the most,"" said Papon, who is an Awami League candidate in the Kishoreganj-6 constituency in the upcoming national elections. The BCB president met with the former Bangladesh ODI captain face-to-face for the first time since the player was left out of the World Cup squad over fitness concerns. After his omission, Tamim alleged in a video on social media that he had a heated conversation over the phone with a member of the top brass of the BCB which led to his exclusion. Papon informed that Tamim contacted him as he wanted to disclose many internal matters of the team which the BCB president didn't know. The BCB head said that he listened to what Tamim had to say but will make his decision after hearing to all parties. ""I won't act on what anyone else says. I first have to understand what the problem is. I want to get to the bottom of the problem. I will speak with everyone, I will learn about everything then I will take the decision myself,"" he said. Papon, who is in his third term as the BCB president, vowed that he will fix all the problems in the national team before his current term ends and is willing to take tough decisions if necessary. ""I'm not going to be around for much longer. This term is about to end. There is one year to go. Before my term ends, my plan is to fix up the team. I will do whatever is necessary.

"Former Pakistan captain Salman Butt, who was banned five years from cricket for his involvement in spot-fixing, was named in the three-member consultant panel to chief selector Wahab Riaz by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) yesterday. This is the first time Butt is being offered an official role with the PCB since his involvement in the Lord's Test spot-fixing row in 2010. Butt, who has played 33 Tests, 78 ODIs and 24 T20Is for Pakistan, returned to domestic cricket after his ban ended in 2015, however, never made it back to the national side. The 39-year-old will now work alongside former Pakistan cricketers Kamran Akmal and Rao Iftikhar Anjum as consultants for the newly appointed chief selector Wahab. Butt will begin his role as consultant from Pakistan's five-match T20I series against New Zealand in next year's January. PCB also named former cricketer Mohammad Hafeez as the new team director and also the team's head coach for their Test series in Australia in December followed by their tour to New Zealand next month. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Just one day after getting appointed as one of the three consultants to chief selector Wahab Riaz, former Pakistan captain Salman Butt has been removed from the position by the country's cricket board after heavy criticism from all fronts. Butt, who was handed a five-year ban from cricket for his involvement in spot-fixing in Pakistan's London Test in 2010, was named as Wahab's consultant alongside former Pakistan cricketers Kamran Akmal and Rao Iftikhar Anjum. This was the first time Butt was appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) since his ban ended in 2015. Butt's appointment created a huge uproar in Pakistan cricket, which eventually led to him getting removed from the position unceremoniously. Chief selector Wahab made the announcement in a press conference on Saturday, where he assured all that Butt won't be involved with the team selection in any capacity. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Soumya Sarkar's return to the Bangladesh ODI and T20I squad for the upcoming New Zealand tour have raised some eyebrows, but selector Habibul Bashar justified his inclusion saying that the 30-year-old is in decent form and his experience will benefit the team against the Kiwis. The stylish left-hander had failed to make an impact in his comeback in ODIs in September against New Zealand at home right before the World Cup, getting dismissed for a duck in the second ODI. But Soumya's recent performance in the National Cricket League (NCL), where he played six matches and scored 436 runs in eleven innings which included four fifties and also picked up 17 wickets, worked in his favour as he is set to return for the Tigers in the white-ball formats once again. The elegant left-hander has scored three fifties and a hundred in 21 innings against New Zealand across all formats and according to Bashar, Soumya's experience in New Zealand conditions was one of the biggest reasons behind his inclusion in the squad. ""Soumya's form is not too poor as he batted well in the first-class competition. It's not like he batted exceptionally well, but an average of 48 is not that bad even though we expect more from him,"" Bashar told the media in Sylhet on Friday. ""The thought process behind picking him is his experience of playing in such conditions along with his all-round abilities,"" he added. The former Bangladesh captain also stated that the absence of seniors like regular skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah Riyad, was also a reason behind Soumya's call back. ""Look we had to make some forced changes since Mahmudullah and Shakib are not available so we lack experienced cricketers in the team. Touring New Zealand has always been challenging for us, it's a place where we normally struggle. ""When we form a team we take a few other aspects into consideration, not just the performance… On that note, those who are relatively experienced and performed decently get preference,"" he said. When asked whether Soumya' inclusion was mainly because of head Chandika Hathurusingha's insistence, Bashar replied, ""I don't think there should be so much discussion over the coach's input since when we pick a team it's after taking everyone's input. The squad is formed only when everyone agrees. We have our choices and the coach has his. It's not that a player is picked only because he is liked by someone,"" said Bashar. Bangladesh will take part in three ODIs and three T20Is in New Zealand. The Tigers will begin their tour with the first of the three-match ODI series on December 17 in Dunedin. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

" Players like Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal are proven and they have the experience. What we want to see is how the youngsters react since they are playing in such conditions for the first time. Although the first of the three-match ODI series against Ireland was abandoned due to rain, a common feature of Bangladesh's stint in Chelmsford, the visitors want to take the challenge of weathering the tough English conditions over the next two games, selector Habibul Bashar informed yesterday. The overcast conditions saw the Tigers undone as the Irish seamers found some early swing in the first ODI. The visitors were struggling on 122 for five after 27 overs, having lost openers Tamim Iqbal and Liton Das inside four overs. Mushfiqur, who turned 36 on Tuesday, was the only Bangladeshi to score 50. Najmul Hossain Shanto showed a glimpse of his fine recent form but was dismissed after scoring 44 while Shakib Al Hasan paid the price for trying to play too aggressively and managed 21 runs. With the next two games scheduled on May 12 and 14 respectively, rain could make things even more tough for the Tigers as they look to adjust to the challenging conditions. According to Bashar, it will be a great experience for the batters in the future if they can get used to seam-friendly conditions. With the upcoming ICC World Cup scheduled in September this year, head coach Chandika Hatahurusingh and the team management will also look at the Ireland series as a way to have a look at a few areas. ""We are not taking this series as a stage to finalise players for the World Cup squad. We will be hosting Afghanistan next month and the Asia Cup is also expected to take place before the World Cup. But the tough conditions will certainly help our batters test their skills, which the players will want to take positively,"" Bashar told The Daily Star. The team management is also looking forward to utilising Mehedi Hasan Miraz as a secod specialist all-rounder alongside Shakib. He was promoted up to No. 7 and the right-hander played some promising innings. Mushfiqur added a valuable 65-run partnership with Miraz to give Bangladesh momentum later in the innings. However, Miraz also missed out on a big score and was caught after scoring 27 off 34 balls with four boundaries. The former Bangladesh captain added that they would keep an eye on performances of the younger crop of cricketers in the team and whether they can make a mark and get into contention for the World Cup squad. ""Players like Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal are proven and they have the experience. What we want to see is how the youngsters react since they are playing in such conditions for the first time,"" he said. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Nic Pothas, newly appointed Bangladesh assistant coach, is excited over the national team's prospect in Test format and the former South Africa batter heaped praise on rising star Towhid Hridoy. ""In your opinion, your guys are not doing as well as you'd like them to do in Tests. That wave will come again. Having seen their ability in the camp and away, there's no reason why we can't get better… We will ride the wave, but I have to take my time to know the players,"" Pothas, who had worked as the head coach of West Indies (2018-2019) and Sri Lanka (2017-2018), told reporters during a presser today. Bangladesh will host Afghanistan in a lone Test from June 14. In 2019, the last time the two nations clashed in a red-ball battle, Afghan spinners had the Bangladesh batters exposed as the hosts suffered a 224-run loss in Chattogram. ""They have a top spin attack, so the challenge is exciting. The excitement is in solving the problem. We have to make sure we have solutions for what they bring,"" said Pothas. Following the Test, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will go on to play white-ball series where batters like Towhid Hridoy will be keen to carry on impressing since his ODI debut against Ireland in March this year. Pothas considers the 22-year-old as a ""phenomenal batsman"" and reckons he has surpassed expectations. ""First and foremost, he is a fantastic kid. He has a high ceiling in terms of his skills. ""Not many people have come into international cricket and all of a sudden done what he has done. ""We expect these young cricketers to come in, and suddenly be world-beaters just like that. It is not possible. He (Towhid) has a lot of potential and a desire to learn. He has a high work ethic. I am excited for what he can do,"" said Pothas. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Despite the fact that Bangladesh lost their last five wickets for just 20 runs upon resuming the second day on 362 for five, by the end of the days' play, it was the Bangladesh bowlers who kept the hosts in the hunt to clinch the lone Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. It was a breath of fresh air to see the pacers utilised on a seam-friendly Mirpur surface to great effect, especially Ebadot Hossain, who picked up four wickets as the visitors were bundled out for 146 runs in their first innings just after the tea break. Another pacer, Shoriful Islam, also bagged two wickets and made a mark. Ebadot also had no regrets about missing out on his second five-wicket haul as the seamer was happy to execute the game plan in such conditions. ""I think this is the first time we got such a pitch and I think we were fortunate enough to be able to play with three seamers in such conditions. We tried our best to bundle out the opponent cheaply and it feels good to be able to successfully execute our game plan,"" Ebadot said. The recent rise in Bangladesh's pace-bowling unit has been significant in breeding a positive mindset for the team management in the longest format. When asked if they were sending the message that the pace unit had the ability to make an impact in conducive conditions, the Sylhet native replied: ""Our pace unit has improved a lot in the past three years or so. I won't say we have become good, but we have been trying to improve the graph for the past three years. We are trying to grab the fast-bowling dominated mindset which world cricket is witnessing at the moment,"" he said. The hosts did not enforce the follow-on despite their 236-run lead and, with half-centurions Najmul Hossain Shanto and Zakir Hossain at the crease and the lead growing to 370 runs, Afghanistan will have a daunting task to save the Test match. Visiting head coach Jonathan Trott admitted that it would be a tough task for the visitors but believed that they should play with pride when asked if it was possible to save the Test. ""It's going to be tough. Obviously, the way the pitch is playing, it's going to be tough.

"Batter Mohammad Naim and pacer Ebadot Hossain will be joining Bangladesh team in Harare for the final ODI against Zimbabwe, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed today. ""As there are a few injury concerns in the team, the team management has decided to send Naim and Ebadot to Zimbabwe in order to increase the squad depth. Both of them will be boarding flight today,"" BCB chief selector Minhajul Abedin Nannu told The Daily Star. Bangladesh, who trail their ongoing three-match ODI series against Zimbabwe 1-0 after a five-wicket loss in the series-opener on Friday, have a few injury concerns. Batter Liton Das has already been ruled out of the entire series with a hamstring injury, whiich he suffered after scoring 81 in the first ODI yesterday. Pacer Shoriful Islam was also unable to complete his 10-over spell in the first ODI after apparently hurting his knee while trying to grab a return catch off his own bowling. Ebadot and Naim, however, will act as back-ups for the final ODI, scheduled for August 10, as Bangladesh are scheduled to play the second ODI tomorrow. ""They [Ebadot and Naim] will be leaving today so they won't be available for tomorrow's game. They will be backups for the final ODI,"" Minhajul added.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It was a one-man show from Mosaddek Hossain as the Bangladesh off-spinner restricted Zimbabwe to 135 for 8 in the second T20I in Harare yesterday. Mosaddek, who became only the fourth Bangladeshi bowler to pick up a five-wicket haul in T20I format, helped the visitors to stage a fightback following a 17-run defeat in the first game on Saturday. It was a much better bowling performance from the Tigers after the dismal show in the first game where Zimbabwe posted a record 205 for 3 on a batting-friendly Harare surface. Mosaddek remained the chief destroyer for the Tigers after Zimbabwe elected to bat as he removed opener Regis Chakabva in the innings' first ball after the right-hander went for a fancy drive and was caught behind without troubling the score. In the same over, a teasing delivery outside the off stump lured Wessley Madhevere (4) to hand a simple catch at cover point. One by one, Mosaddek went on to remove the next three batters in as many overs, which he bowled on the trot, leaving Zimbabwe wobbling at 31 for 5 inside seven overs. The part time off spinner, realising the importance of pace variation, bowled a lot slower to dismiss Zimbabwean skipper Craig Ervine (1), who brought his downfall by opting for a reverse sweep and deflected the ball from his gloves to get caught at slip. Bangladesh were on a roll when Mosaddek removed the dangerous Sean Williams (8) with a sharp return catch and achieved the rare feat of a fifer by dismissing Shumba (3). The 26-year-old ended up with impressive figures of five for 20 from his four overs, which is also the joint second-best bowling figure by a Bangladeshi in the format, equalling Shakib Al Hasan's career-best figures in T20Is. Left-arm spinner Elias Sunny leads the chart for Bangladesh with figures of five for 13 against Ireland back in 2012, while Mustafizur Rahman's five for 22 against New Zealand in the 2016 ICC T20 World Cup puts him in the fourth spot. Skipper Nurul Hasan Sohan's gamble to hand Mosaddek to open the innings, despite having four specialist bowlers in the line-up, paid off completely and the cricketer from Mymensingh capitalised on the opportunity. Interestingly, Mosaddek had scalped a five-wicket haul just once in the List A competition and his maiden fifer in international cricket came when the Tigers desperately needed something special from the bowlers. Wickets aside, he enforced a tight leash on the Zimbabwean batters, bowling 15 dot deliveries in his four overs quota, causing the home side to commit unforced errors. Mosaddek, who had picked just seven wickets in his previous 19 T20Is, became the only Bangladeshi bowler to pick all of the top five wickets of a team yesterday. Although Zimbabwe managed to recover from the early slump by riding on Sikandar Raza's second consecutive fifty in the series, the visitors got the platform to keep the three-match series alive.  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director Akram Khan feels that the 'battle of words' right before the World Cup was the main reason behind the team's abysmal performance in the showpiece event in India. ""The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That's why we as a nation didn't perform well,"" Akram told the media in Mirpur today. ""The players need to go and perform on the field. We couldn't do that. We were busy talking about off the field topics. Everyone needs to realise that,"" he added. The Tigers had a disappointing showing in the World Cup in India, losing seven out of their nine matches to finish eighth in the 10-team competition. The Bangladesh team went through a change in captaincy a little over a month before the World Cup when Tamim Iqbal stepped down and Shakib Al Hasan stepped up as the skipper. The drama only increased when Tamim got axed from the World Cup squad for being unfit. The opener refuted that claim in a video posted on social media, which was then countered by Shakib in a pre-recorded interview, where he labelled Tamim's action as 'childish'. The chaos in the buildup evidently didn't help the team's cause in the World Cup. Without naming anyone in particular, Akram said that clashes between individuals handicapped Bangladesh in the tournament. ""This country belongs to all of us. If Bangladesh do well, all of us will feel happy. But if some people only do things as they wish, then this will not happen. ""I've always noticed that during major tournaments we talk too much about things which aren't related to the game. That puts everyone under pressure. He was also critical of the experiments made to the squad by the team management in the matches leading up to the World Cup. ""I had said this before, the Asia Cup could've been the ideal tournament for the players who will take part in the World Cup. But we experimented with the team in that tournament and eventually couldn't form a stable unit. I don't think any team can do well after so much experimentation."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan Papon visited the Tigers' team hotel in the capital on Thursday at Shakib Al Hasan's request but could not meet the star all-rounder, who was reportedly busy fulfilling a commercial commitment elsewhere. According to the BCB president, the purpose of his visit to the team hotel was to 'meet Shakib' and also to 'lend courage' to the players after their three-wicket defeat in the first ODI against England on Wednesday. ""There is a singular reason why I came here [to the team hotel]. I could not meet Shakib during my first visit to the team hotel before the first ODI. That's why I came today at Shakib's request. Actually, I came here to see everyone and give them courage,"" Hassan told the media after meeting the players on Thursday, a day before the Tigers are set to play the series decider against England. However, as Shakib was unavailable, Hassan said he had spoken with the all-rounder on the phone. ""I talked with him [Shakib] on the phone. After he learned that I was about to visit [the team hotel], he called me and said that he was elsewhere. He told me, 'Come after 9:00pm.' And I replied, 'Look, it's okay as you are busy. I don't have much to say [to Shakib and others]. I just dropped by and I will just have a few words with them [other team members who were present at the team hotel]. I will talk to you over the phone later at night.' I told him that I would talk to him over the phone,"" Hassan explained. Asked how the conversation with Shakib on the phone would be like, Hassan said: ""Just talk to him in general. There is nothing much to say, it's just about giving him courage."" Hassan had visited the team hotel last Monday ahead of the first ODI as well. That time also he could not meet Shakib. According to Hassan's words, Shakib asked him if 'he could meet him the day after as he was busy with some work' that day. Earlier, Hassan confirmed in an interview that the perceived 'rift' between stalwarts Shakib and Tamim Iqbal was in fact true only to later claim that all that he heard about the 'rift' and an 'unhealthy dressing room environment' were all from 'outside, especially the media'. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Bangladesh slumped to a 142-run defeat against Afghanistan in the second and penultimate ODI on Saturday to lose their first-ever ODI series against the visitors. The Tigers have enjoyed a healthy record at home and the series defeat was only their third at home since 2016. The question that most comes to mind is whether the defeat had more to do with non-cricketing reasons than cricketing ones. ""Please stick to cricket. Don't step outside of cricket. When players coming up in the future do well, write about it. When they play badly, write about that too and criticise them; that is all good. We all know that sometimes we overstep our boundaries,"" was a message from ODI skipper Tamim Iqbal towards the media during his retirement announcement on Thursday, July 6 – a decision he would withdraw on July 7. As a cricket reporter however, watching Bangladesh perform on July 8, it was difficult to just ""stick to cricket"". Of course, there were cricketing reasons. The bowlers were not able to create pressure and keep a batter at one end for long. Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Ibrahim Zadran had a field day rotating the strike; punishing loose balls which were aplenty. The Afghan spinners were a handful and it was once again portrayed that trying to read them, after the delivery had already landed, was a difficult task and the Tigers had a torrid time. But beyond that, the larger picture and the reasons for that performance were beyond just cricket. The body language of the players, lacking in concrete ideas or execution of plans, were all on view. As if they had turned subpar in a matter of days. Before every series there used to be some noise that used to distract players but for a few months or so, from the T20 World Cup to head coach Chandika Hathursingha's arrival and beyond, things had stayed relatively quiet. Barring the usual Shakib Al Hasan controversy, which usually stays as an individual's issue separate from the whole team, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had not given fuel to fire and the Tigers enjoyed a serene time. In an interview, the BCB president then brought along fresh controversy to the public eye regarding Shakib and Tamim's rift and division within the team. The can of worms did not open further due to subsequent quiet from the board president. He had also said back in February that it would be hard for the head coach to find him this time around in the Sri Lankan's second stint. Despite that, when Tamim inadvertently talked about his fitness ahead of the first ODI in Chattogram on July 4, the BCB president brought up more information in another interview. He reiterated that Hathurusingha was not happy with Tamim's revelation. The ensuing chaos then came to a head when Tamim took the decision to retire from international cricket, followed by his withdrawal the next day. These problems surface from the team management's, and in extension, the board's inability to solve the team's issues internally. While the media's task is to report on inconsistencies, as the governing body of Bangladesh cricket, BCB's officials need more nuance to handle the team's own environment. It should not be about giving the media half-truth or no information but about its own handling of the situation. Now a complete quiet has come up. The board officials have been asked to not comment to the media as if the very air should stand still. Thus, opinions regarding what happened to the team are also being kept close to the pocket. As far as analysis should go, there is more than just cricket arching over the current passage of play. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"The kind of bat speed Tawhid Hridoy generates has already been a telling factor since his introduction to international cricket. At the highest level, however, technique and mentality are opposite sides of the same coin. Hridoy showed he can stand up to such situations while having that clarity of mind in the first T20I against Afghanistan on Friday. The targeting of specific bowlers was the plan and Hridoy executed. The way he picked off Azmatullah Omarzai over backward square-leg for a six in the second T20I is the kind of display now changing how the Tigers can approach the shortest format. Replying to a question about that particular shot, the 22-year-old gave the idea of freeness. ""It's normal. When the ball arrived, my body automatically went for it,"" he told The Daily Star in an interview yesterday. ""Yes maybe no one here has played it before but they have started and slowly they will play these kinds of shots more,"" he was confident the mindset is changing. That kind of confidence is also now rubbing off, transforming Bangladesh with each shot he plays. Yet, younger players are often found wanting at the big stage. Hridoy wants to go a different way and play such scenarios more frequently. ""In T20s, the matches fluctuate a lot and it's important to execute. I feel that any batter able to chase in such a game would get a big confidence boost. These kinds of scenarios don't arrive frequently. I would want every batter to bat in such situations because then they will get the confidence,"" he affirmed. While Fazalhaq Farooqi has been the pick of the bowlers in the recently concluded series, Hridoy kept his calm to read the scenario, knowing that the whole attack was quality. ""It doesn't matter to me whether it's spin or pace. Rashid Khan, Mujeeb [Ur Rehman] and [Mohammad] Nabi are very good bowlers. In T20s it's important to target one or two bowlers from the opposition. We also planned for the match in that way. ""Our plan, not only speaking of Farooqi or Omarzai, was that it was a better option to go for their pacers rather than their spinners. It's about the calculative risks you take according to various match scenarios. If the situation had demanded that we would have to take on Rashid khan, then we would have tried to take him on too,"" he underlined. Even during his brief international career, he has falsely been tagged as a leg-side oriented player. ""Many are saying that I am hitting through one zone only but it's not like that. I'm playing through cover as well. I have hit through mid-off as well in the first T20I. It depends on the situation. Would I not hit it if it's in the leg-side zone?"" he argued. The clarity of mind means his calculations have come off through early hard thinking. Then the bat swings freely and decisively and it is the absence of fear of repercussions that helps him think clearly. Was he fearful he could get out to Farooqi while playing his favourite shot, the pull? ""In any walk of life, whether in your profession or mine, when you are fearful, the outcome wouldn't be good. It's best to not keep fear within yourself. What will happen? Maybe I will play badly or the team will lose or maybe I will be dropped. What more can happen? ""So personally, I think that way and feel that this isn't a game of fear. You have to keep your mind fresh and be courageous or else you won't be able to survive,"" he concludes, knowing that only a similar mindset will change Bangladesh's fortunes in the shortest format. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It appears that Bangladesh Test and T20I skipper Shakib Al Hasan and Liton Das will not be allowed to skip the upcoming Ireland Test from April 04, as far as Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan Papon is concerned, after the two star cricketers applied for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to the BCB in order to be present from the beginning of the Indian Premier League (IPL), slated to begin on March 31. ""You see, I have been asked about this issue over and over again, and I've given a single answer. Before they were called in the IPL auction, they [IPL officials] asked us about the [players'] availability and we gave them [the schedule]. And knowing this, they proceeded with the auction,"" said the BCB boss after the Tigers handed Ireland a 10-wicket defeat in Sylhet on Thursday to win the three-match ODI series 2-0. ""I don't see any option for them [Shakib, Liton] to be unavailable [during the Bangladesh game]. It's not like we had told them that we might think about it [granting clearance], then there would've been some doubt. We have made it clear. ""I don't see any chance of a change of heart, to be honest,"" reiterated the BCB boss, adding that he would let the media know if the decision from the board does not stand.   আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"It was an anticlimactic finish to the 2023 World Cup for arguably the largest cricketing fanbase -- India fans -- as they saw the best team on paper tumbling at the final hurdle only for Australia to clinch their sixth title last week. With 10 straight victories, statistically, India remained the most successful team in the last World Cup as the tournament winners themselves boast a victory less than the Men in Blue. Seeing that dominating run end at the final stage to a team that they had already beaten in the group stage was definitely not what over 100,000 raucous fans at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad expected. And even though the sea of blue was kept quiet during the course of that six-wicket win by the Aussies, India fans made their presence known -- mostly in an unfortunate manner -- almost from the moment the game came to a close. The latest outburst was by an RTI activist, who filed an FIR in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh against Australia all-rounder Mitchell Marsh for keeping his feet on the World Cup trophy during celebrations in the Aussie dressing room following the final. Cummins shared a picture of Marsh with his feet on the coveted trophy on social media, with media and fans deservedly accusing him of disrespecting the biggest prize in cricket history. ""I am hurt. The trophy for which all the teams in the world fight, the trophy which you want to lift over your head, keeping a foot on that trophy did not make me happy,"" India pacer Mohammed Shami, top wicket-taker with 24 scalps this World Cup, said on Thursday. Shami's condemnation is understandable as it was kept just within a few words of dissatisfaction. Undoubtedly, Marsh's act was condemnable, but the question remains if it was something that warranted the start of a criminal procedure. According to local media reports, the alleged complaint against the 32-year-old all-rounder is that he deliberately humiliated 140 crore Indians by his gesture. The police officials also reportedly accepted the case and filed an FIR based on the same. A copy of the FIR was also sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to prohibit Marsh, who features regularly in the Indian Premier League, from playing in India moving forward. If Marsh's act in a frenzied post-triumphant environment was indeed a 'deliberate' one to 'humiliate', the hurls of boos from the crowd at the umpire Richard Kettleborough while collecting his medal after the final, the chants of 'Kohli, Kohli' when Cummins lifted the trophy, and most importantly, the vile social media attacks on Aussie cricketers' wives may need some categorisation as well. Glenn Maxwell's wife Vini Raman, who is of Indian descent, responded to the hate messages as she wrote on Instagram: ""Aaaaand cue all the hateful vile DMs. Stay classy… Can't believe this needs to be said BUT you can be Indian and also support the country of your birth where you have been raised and more importantly the team your husband plus father of your child plays in #nobrainer. Take a chill pill and direct that outrage towards more important world issues."" The FIR incident took place three days after Maxwell's wife urged for the 'outrage' to be directed somewhere important, so it is clear that the Indian fans failed to comprehend the logic behind it. But maybe, it is time that they start doing so -- if at all the 'outrage' is justified. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Mohammed Shami criticised former Pakistan cricketers who inferred that the Indian bowlers were getting unfair advantages during the recently-concluded World Cup and advised them to correct their ways. ""I wasn't playing at the start of the World Cup. When I did, I took five wickets, then four in the next match, then five again. Some former Pakistani players couldn't accept it, but what can I do about that,"" Shami said in a recent interview with sportswear brand Puma. Shami was the standout bowler in the World Cup, finishing as the tournament's highest wicket-taker with 24 scalps in just seven matches. The Indian bowling attack dominated the opposition throughout the tournament and outperformed the opposing bowling attack by some distance right until the final, where Pat Cummins' Australia handed India their first ever defeat in an ODI World Cup final. While the Indian attack was running through every opposition, some former Pakistan cricketers claimed that the hosts were bowling with a different ball, which helped the bowl better. Shami rubibshed those claims, and said it was unfortunate that former cricketers would peddle such conspiracy theories. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company's ball. Please, mend your ways,"" said the 33-year-old. ""I could still understand if it wasn't a player (making such comments)... But you are an ex-player. I don't think people can react in any other way than laugh about such things…I realise that I am being quite harsh with my words, but we have to call out such things.""  আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Nick Kyrgios said he is ""thankful"" to Andy Murray for looking out for him after he spotted signs of self-harm on the Australian's body. Former tennis world number one Rafael Nadal will return at the Brisbane International warm up event for the Australian Open in January, the Spaniard said on Friday. Novak Djokovic said he accepts responsibility for Serbia's Davis Cup semi-final defeat by Italy on Saturday after failing to convert three match points against Jannik Sinner. At 36 years old Djokovic is still tennis' number one player by some distance and he has racked up a host of new records this season, taking his Grand Slam tally to 24 and finishing top of the year-end world rankings for the eighth time. Novak Djokovic closed in on a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title on Saturday after sweeping past Carlos Alcaraz 6-3, 6-2 in a dominating semi-final display he hailed as his best of the tournament. Meanwhile, Ruman Sana and Diya Siddique suffered elimination from their respective events. Alex de Minaur guided Australia into a second successive Davis Cup final with an assured 2-0 win over Finland on Friday in Malaga. The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) president Morinari Watanabe pledged their support to the Bangladesh Gymnastics Federation (BGF) to help achieve its goal of winning an Olympic medal in the 2028 Games after attending its development committee meeting in Dhaka yesterday. Djokovic was enraged as some fans tried to drown out his victory speech with drums, which the superstar said he felt he had to respond to. Organisers said nearly 70,000 of these newly released tickets would cost 24 euros ($26), the lowest price category of any of the tickets sold for the Games. Ronnie O'Sullivan has warned he will quit snooker if he is restricted from playing non-tour events in China, saying his career is at a ""crossroads"". Serbia are one of the eight surviving nations from September's group phase and will face Britain on Thursday. ""It's very tough seeing children, babies dying every day,"" she said. Starting from third on the grid, the Red Bull driver stole the lead at the start and then dominated the race, which was punctuated by a lengthy red flag stoppage when Kevin Magnussen crashed heavily in his Haas. Spain's Jorge Martin won a thrilling Thailand MotoGP race Sunday to close the gap on Francesco Bagnaia in the world championship race.

"Nick Kyrgios said he is ""thankful"" to Andy Murray for looking out for him after he spotted signs of self-harm on the Australian's body. The 28-year-old has previously opened up about the mental health struggles he has battled throughout his career and in June revealed in a Netflix documentary he had spent time in a psychiatric hospital after losing at Wimbledon in 2019. ""Andy was always a big supporter of me,"" Kyrgios said in an interview with Piers Morgan Uncensored on TalkTV. ""As soon as I came on the tour, he kind of saw a work in progress and took me under his wing. ""Then he realised later in my career that I don't think I was coachable or I was on my own path, but he was always someone that was looking out for me. ""He saw it (the self-harm), and he said, 'What's that on your arm?' It was pretty bad at that stage. Andy obviously was trying to give me advice on it. But I was just so stuck in my ways at that time that I didn't listen. ""Obviously I'm very thankful. I thank him a lot."" Kyrgios wrote a lengthy Instagram post in February last year about his mental health struggles, at the end of which he said he was in a much better place. Currently sidelined through injury, the Australian said he feels proud for being able to help people who are having mental health issues. ""I've almost been a beacon for people who are struggling,"" he added. ""When they feel like they're overwhelmed and they're going towards drinking, drugs and stuff, they open up and they feel like I'm relatable,"" Kyrgios said.

"Novak Djokovic closed in on a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title on Saturday after sweeping past Carlos Alcaraz 6-3, 6-2 in a dominating semi-final display he hailed as his best of the tournament. Carlos Alcaraz is dreaming of victory at the ATP Finals after setting up a semi-final showdown with Novak Djokovic with Friday's 6-4, 6-4 win over Daniil Medvedev. World number one Novak Djokovic beat ATP Finals alternate Hubert Hurkacz 7-6(1) 4-6 6-1 in their Green Group clash on Thursday and advanced to the semi-finals after Jannik Sinner edged Holger Rune 6-2 5-7 6-4 in the evening match. Russian Zverev put on a powerful display to see off world number two. The 24-time Grand Slam champion needed just one win or a defeat for young rival Carlos Alcaraz in order to secure top spot in the ATP rankings for 2023 and prevailed in a three-hour Green Group clash with spirited debutant Rune. The 36-year-old Djokovic eclipsed his previous record set two years ago as the tournament's oldest champion, capturing his 40th Masters 1000 title and stretching his winning run to 18 matches. Novak Djokovic rallied to defeat Andrey Rublev 5-7, 7-6 (7/3), 7-5 in a gripping Paris Masters semi-final on Saturday, earning a shot at a record-extending seventh title in the final against Grigor Dimitrov. ""It's very tough seeing children, babies dying every day,"" she said. Djokovic will spearhead Serbia at the tournament from December 29-January 7 in Sydney and Perth as he builds towards the defence of his Australian Open title. The world number two said he had been ""out of my mind"" during his semi-final match against Jannik Sinner in the Chinese capital, which the Italian won 7-6 (7/4), 6-1. ","sports"
"Novak Djokovic demolished Alex de Minaur for the loss of just five games to sweep into a 13th Australian Open quarter-final and send an ominous warning Monday, showing few signs of his troublesome hamstring. Player-turned commentator Jelena Dokic lashed out Monday at the ""disgusting"" body-shaming she has endured online while working at the Australian Open. World number two Rafael Nadal slumped to a second-straight defeat at the United Cup Monday in a setback to his Australian Open preparations, but Stefanos Tsitsipas and Iga Swiatek were both on song. The much-awaited Women’s Asia Cup, played in the 20-over format since 2012, returns with its eighth edition in Sylhet as the curtain-raiser sees defending champions Bangladesh take on Thailand at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium Ground 2 (SICS Outer) today from Bangladesh Standard Time 9:00 am. Pakistan coach Saqlain Mushtaq defended his team's Twenty20 playing style after losing Sunday's Asia Cup final, saying they were on the right track for next month's T20 World Cup. Dasun Shanaka's Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 23 runs in Dubai on Sunday to clinch their sixth Asia Cup. Bhanuka Rajapaksa on Sunday said Sri Lanka's cricket has proved a point to the world with their sixth Asia Cup title after his unbeaten 71 set up a commanding 23-run win over Pakistan. Skipper Dasun Shanaka on Sunday called the Asia Cup triumph a ""real turnaround"" for Sri Lankan cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup and dedicated the win to the crisis-hit nation. 'It was a team effort,' a very proud Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said after his side's Asia Cup triumph on Sunday. Sri Lanka won their sixth Asia Cup title as the Dasun Shanaka-led side handed a 23-run defeat to Pakistan in the final of the Asia Cup in Dubai tonight. Bhanuka Rajapaksa smashed an unbeaten 71 to guide Sri Lanka to 170-6 after Pakistan's Haris Rauf rattled the opposition with early wickets in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. As the five-time Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka are set to battle it out against two-time winners Pakistan in the final of the continental tournament’s 15th edition in Dubai tonight at 8:00pm Bangladesh Standard Time, the task of picking the favourites on paper becomes virtually impossible. Sri Lanka exude confidence at the moment, having secured four back-to-back victories that begun with the win over Bangladesh. They geared for the final with a win in the dead-rubber Super Four stage game against Pakistan in what was a dress rehearsal for the final. Their plans have been like clockwork, especially with the bat. In Dubai, the centre-stage for the Pakistan-Sri Lanka final today, there was no intense media activity with both teams having opted to stay within their hotel, foregoing practice sessions and media conference. Bangladeshi umpire Masudur Rahman Mukul will be conducting the Aisa Cup final between Pakistan and Sri Lanka on Sunday as one of the two on-field umpires. Sri Lanka are poised for an unlikely Asia Cup victory over favourites Pakistan in Sunday's final after a giant-slaying streak through the tournament despite troubles at home. Spinner Wanindu Hasaranga led Sri Lanka’s bowling charge to set up a comfortable five-wicket victory over Pakistan on Friday in their dress rehearsal for the Asia Cup final. When it comes to death-over bowling, the 2022 Asia Cup has seen pretty sub-par performances from a few bowlers. Pakistan’s Harris Rauf and India’s Arshdeep Singh have been the most reliable names in the tournament, but in general, runs have been leaked and the biggest boost it has given is to batters who played the role of finisher in the T20 event.

"Novak Djokovic demolished Alex de Minaur for the loss of just five games to sweep into a 13th Australian Open quarter-final and send an ominous warning Monday, showing few signs of his troublesome hamstring. The Serbian brushed past the Australian 22nd seed 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena to move a step closer to a 10th title at Melbourne Park, and 22 major crown. With his left thigh again heavily strapped, the 35-year-old was a man on a mission, expending as little energy as possible in a 2hrs 6mins romp to inch within sight of Rafael Nadal's slam record. He will meet fifth seed Andrey Rublev for a semi-final berth after the Russian toppled Danish teen Holger Rune in a tense five-set clash on the same court. ""I really wanted to win in straight sets,"" said Djokovic, who will return to world number one for the first time since June if he wins the tournament. ""Obviously you never know what's going to happen on the court ... I thought first four or five games were quite close, but after one break in the first set I felt more loose and free to go through the ball and be more aggressive. ""I played the best match of this year so far."" Victory put him into a 13th Melbourne quarter-final to move fourth on the all-time list behind Roger Federer, Nadal and John Newcombe. It is his 54th Grand Slam quarter-final in total -- second only to the retired Federer's 58. De Minaur, who recorded his first victory against a top-five player in November when he beat Daniil Medvedev at the Paris Masters, was always facing an uphill climb. Djokovic has not lost in Melbourne since 2018 -- he did not play in 2022 -- and has now won 25 consecutive matches at the Australian Open. He always had the measure of the young Australian and broke to love in game six, consolidating without dropping a point for 5-2. With de Minaur struggling under the pressure, he sent a baseline forehand long to hand the Serb another break and the set in just 35 minutes. Only 54 percent of De Minaur's first serves went in compared to Djokovic's 76 percent, with the winners 9-1 in favour of the dominant Serb. De Minaur won the sixth game in the second set, ending a run of nine consecutive losses, but it was only a brief moment of respite. Djokovic stretched his hamstring at the changeover and immediately applied pressure again on De Minaur's first service game to break again in the third set, all but ending the match. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Novak Djokovic has been fortunate to have opponents like Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal to push him during his career, his coach Goran Ivanisevic said on Sunday after the 36-year-old claimed the U.S. Open title for a 24th Grand Slam crown. The 'Big Three' dominated men's tennis over the last two decades with a collective 66 Grand Slam titles between them but Djokovic is now clear of the retired Federer (20) and Nadal (22), who is expected to call time on his career next year. ""He's a winner,"" former Wimbledon champion Ivanisevic told reporters. ""He's the guy who is motivating himself. ""He had luck to have guys like Nadal and Federer, they came before him, so they pushed each other. ""When you tell him he can't do something, it's even worse. Then he's going to show you that he can do it. No excuses. He always tries to find a way to win, to fight, even when he's not feeling well, injured, not injured."" Ivanisevic, who has been coaching Djokovic since 2019, said he considered the Serb's U.S. Open triumph - which put him level with Margaret Court with the most major singles titles - as ""the biggest achievement in sporting history"". The 51-year-old added that he was not surprised by Djokovic's hunger. ""He's just enjoying, he likes the challenges. Like you ask me 25 (majors), yeah, if he wins 25 he's going to think, 'If I win 25, why not 26?' It's always one more, something more,"" Ivanisevic said. ""He's taking care of his body, he's taking care of everything, every single detail has to be perfect, prepared. He's never happy on the court. ""I don't know if that's good or bad, not good for us,"" he said smiling. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"A tearful Roger Federer ended his historic career with defeat alongside long-time rival Rafael Nadal in a doubles match at the Laver Cup in the early hours of Saturday. The 20-time Grand Slam champion, 41, and Nadal, playing for Team Europe, went down 6-4, 6-7 (2/7), 9-11 against Team World's Frances Tiafoe and Jack Sock. The result felt a mere formality as pictures and videos of Federer and Nadal - who shared one of tennis's most enthralling rivalries - crying together after combining for Team Europe in a doubles defeat at London's O2 Arena went viral on social media, leaving their legions of fans highly emotional. The heart-warming scene has been shared by many fans along with their messages and former India captain Virat Kohli too has been left overwhelmed with the moment. Sharing the photo on Twitter, Kohli posted an emotional tribute to both the tennis legends. ""Who thought rivals can feel like this towards each other. That's the beauty of sport. This is the most beautiful sporting picture ever for me. When your companions cry for you, you know why you've been able to do with your god given talent.

"India's Virat Kohli struck a record 50th hundred in one-dayers to power the unbeaten hosts to 397 for four wickets against New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday. Kohli's knock of 117, which came off 113 balls, gave him the record for the highest number of centuries in the 50-overs format of the game, taking him past Sachin Tendulkar with the Indian batting great present in the stands to applaud. After scampering for two runs off fast bowler Lockie Ferguson to get to his mark, Kohli took off his helmet and bowed to the stands where television cameras showed Tendulkar and former England soccer captain David Beckham standing and clapping in appreciation. The 35-year-old hit nine fours and two sixes before holing out in the deep off fast bowler Tim Southee, who took three wickets for 100. Shreyas Iyer's blistering 105, which came off just 70 balls and was studded with four fours and eight sixes, provided the late fireworks for India's innings. India captain Rohit Sharma, who made 47, won the toss and decided to bat and gave the hosts a rollicking start with a 71-run opening stand with Shubman Gill. Gill retired hurt due to leg cramps but returned later to bat again, remaining unbeaten on 80. The venue, where India won their last 50-overs World Cup title, has hosted four day-night contests so far at this tournament with three of those being won by the team batting first. Australia were the only team to win batting second at the ground after Glenn Maxwell hit an unbeaten double hundred. India have looked invincible so far, winning all nine of their round robin matches including a four-wicket victory over the Black Caps in Dharamsala. New Zealand, however, defeated India at the same stage of the 2019 edition. Australia and South Africa will meet in the second semi-final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens, with the final to be held on Sunday in Ahmedabad. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"UEFA has started an investigation after sex noises disrupted the the broadcast of the Euro 2024 draw on Saturday. Lewd noises could be heard as Switzerland were drawn in Group A with Scotland, Hungary and hosts Germany. Host Giorgio Marchetti, the deputy general secretary of European football's governing body, attempted to take control of the situation, saying: ""There is some noise here that... has now stopped. No noise anymore."" England manager Gareth Southgate, who was present at the draw, said he could vaguely hear the noises while sitting in the audience. ""I'm assuming it was some sort of a prank, but it was hard to really make out what it was,"" he said. YouTube prankster Daniel Jarvis claimed responsibility for both that and the latest prank. Jarvis broadcast himself live on X, formerly Twitter, ringing a mobile phone at intervals to trigger the noises as the Euros draw, which was streamed on the BBC, took place in Hamburg, Germany. He told viewers: ""Listen that was us, that was us. We got it in there, we put the phone in there, we rung it, sex noise at the Euro 2024 draw.""

"Celtic have been fined 15,200 pounds ($19,000) after their fans waved Palestinian flags during their Champions League match against Atletico Madrid last month in Glasgow, UEFA said on Wednesday. The flags, which numbered in the hundreds, were deemed to be ""provocative messages of an offensive nature"", UEFA said in a statement. Fans, who had been warned by the Scottish club not to display flags before the Oct. 25 game, could be heard singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" while holding the Palestinian flags in a video shared widely on Instagram. Supporters also unfurled two large banners at Celtic Park that read ""Free Palestine"" and ""Victory to the Resistance"". Gaza's Hamas-run government says at least 13,300 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 5,600 children, in the war with Israel.

"Rafael Leao ended a difficult week with the only goal in Saturday's 1-0 win over Verona which drew AC Milan level with Serie A leaders Inter Milan, while Juventus fell to their first defeat of the season, 4-2 at Sassuolo. Portugal winger Leao netted his third goal in as many league matches in the eighth minute at a sodden San Siro to move Milan up to second on 12 points from five games. Inter defend their 100 percent start at rock-bottom Empoli on Sunday. Leao's winner was one of the few highlights of a largely uninspiring performance from a much-changed Milan side missing injured captain Davide Calabria and France pair Mike Maignan and Theo Hernandez. But it was a welcome three points after being destroyed by local rivals Inter last weekend and failing to capitalise on their dominance in Tuesday's Champions League stalemate with Newcastle United. Milan's star man Leao, wearing the skipper's armband in Calabria's absence, answered some of his critics following poor displays in both of those matches, even becoming a figure of fun for falling over his own feet while trying to backheel in a goal against Newcastle. ""He just needs to keep going and realise that when you become a great player you need to overcome or at least deal with a lot of pressure,"" said Milan coach Stefano Pioli. Kick-off was delayed by nearly half an hour due to a sudden hailstorm which battered Milan, and the away fans then ruined the pre-match minute's silence in honour of former Italian president Giorgio Napolitano, who died aged 98 on Friday. Napolitano, who was head of state between 2006 and 2015, was a leading member of Italy's Communist Party from the 1970s until its dissolution in 1991, while Verona's hardcore support is among the most right-wing in a country where fascist fan groups are widespread. A large, notoriously far-right section of Lazio fans also booed and sang through the minute's silence in their team's 1-1 home draw with Monza. Milan supporters meanwhile drowned out the Verona supporters with an enthusiastic applause, started by both sets of players, as they were also remembering former Italy midfielder Giovanni Lodetti. Lodetti, who also died on Friday aged 81, won two Serie A titles and two European Cups in the 1960s in a Milan side led by icon Gianni Rivera, and was also part of the Azzurri team which claimed the 1968 European Championship on home soil. Szczesny's bad day Juventus are two points behind the Milan clubs in fourth after falling to an awful, error-strewn defeat at Sassuolo. Andrea Pinamonti's fourth goal of the season in the 82nd minute, after Wojciech Szczesny patted out Armand Lauriente's shot to the Italy international, and a stoppage time Federico Gatti own goal made sure of the points for Sassuolo just as Juve looked set for a grandstand finish. ""We had our heads in the clouds... we started OK but we had some good opportunities that we didn't take advantage of,"" said coach Massimiliano Allegri to DAZN. ""They scored with their first attempt on goal and then we lost our heads."" It was a bad day for Poland goalkeeper Szczesny as he was at fault for Lauriente's 12th-minute opener and shown up by a Domenico Berardi strike which restored the hosts' lead four minutes from the break after Matias Vina's own goal put the away side level. Szczesny also gave Gatti a bad pass which the young defender inexplicably volleyed back into his own goal. Berardi was a summer target for Juve who failed to present a bid which could tempt Sassuolo to sell the Italy winger, who crowned his 300th Serie A appearance with his 116th goal in the division. Pinamonti's strike came four minutes after Federico Chiesa thought he had set up a chance to snatch the points by levelling for Juventus with a deflected strike. It was Chiesa's fourth goal of the season but instead of pushing Juve on to the win Allegri's team collapsed to a poor loss. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Stefano Pioli insisted on Monday that AC Milan have turned their attentions to the Champions League opener with Newcastle United after the local derby humiliation at the weekend. The seven-time European champions were hammered 5-1 by Serie A leaders Inter Milan on Saturday, a brutal defeat which swept away all the positive vibes created by a new-look team claiming three straight wins before the international break. It was a fifth defeat in as many Milan derbies in 2023, Inter racking up an aggregate score of 12-1 over those matches which include last season's Champions League semi-final. ""We had a lot of faith and positivity for the derby but it didn't go well, there's no point hiding it,"" Pioli told reporters. ""It was a big disappointment, but we have the Champions League and that is good as it's the only way to switch. ""These defeats in the derby hurt... I'd give everything to change them but unfortunately they went how they went."" Milan have been drawn in a tough Group F which also features Borussia Dortmund and French champions Paris Saint-Germain, and a good start at home to Saudi Arabia-backed Newcastle would be the perfect response to Saturday's disappointment. ""I know I have a good team, this group of players will be able to get over a really difficult derby,"" said Pioli. ""I owe a debt to the fans because last year when we were struggling, when we were playing really badly, they stayed behind us."" Sandro Tonali will return to the San Siro earlier than expected after being sold to Newcastle in July, one of two big changes over the summer with club icon Paolo Maldini being sacked as technical director. Italy midfielder Tonali is a boyhood Milan fan and was a key component of the team which won a first league title in 11 years in 2022. ""It will be emotional. Sandro is a great player and was important to us getting where we are today,"" said Pioli. ""We won together and we grew together, and it will be emotional for him to return to the San Siro. We wish him the very best -- from the next match."" Newcastle come into their first Champion League match in two decades off the back of a 1-0 win over Brentford which halted a run of three straight Premier League defeats. Tonali is fit to play on Tuesday after recovering from a thigh strain which meant he missed both of Italy's recent Euro 2024 qualifiers and admitted it was difficult leaving Milan. ""I will obviously have strong feelings but I won't know what it means to have come back until I play at the San Siro,"" said the 23-year-old. ""It was a difficult summer... Milan is the team I support and the team that gave me a chance to realise a dream, I'll have to do my best to manage my feelings."" আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"AC Milan starlet Francesco Camarda made history on Saturday after becoming the youngest ever player to play in Serie A during Saturday's 1-0 win over Fiorentina. Attacker Camarda took to the field in the 83rd minute at the San Siro aged 15 years, eight months and 15 days, replacing Luka Jovic. ""He's got a lot of talent and intelligence, he knows that he needs to work harder than everyone else,"" said Milan captain Davide Calabria after the match. Camarda, who made headlines when he scored a bicycle kick against Paris Saint-Germain in the UFA Youth League, had very little to do as Milan largely defended late-on in Saturday's win. He beat the previous record held by Bologna defender Wisdom Amey, who made his Serie A debut in May 2022 aged 15 years, nine months and one day. Camarda was called up from Milan's youth set-up amid a series of absences including Olivier Giroud, Rafael Leao and Noah Okafor.

"Italy's Milan giants face off in Saturday's local derby which pits Serie A's form teams against one another in a match which will give an early indication of their title credentials. The San Siro will host a rematch of last season's Champions League semi-final, a fixture that promises similar fireworks to the two blockbuster clashes in May which went Inter Milan's way. Inter and AC Milan are locked on nine points at the top of the table after perfect starts from both in which summer signings have made an immediate impact. Simone Inzaghi's Inter have scored eight times without conceding in their opening three matches thanks to a strike partnership between Lautaro Martinez and new arrival Marcus Thuram which has brought seven goals. Milan meanwhile have a trio of new signings thrilling fans alongside their established stars, with Tijjani Reijnders and Chelsea old boys Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Cristian Pulisic hitting the ground running. Stefano Pioli has Milan playing an entertaining, fluid style of football boosted by Pulisic's presence on the right wing, which has freed up star man Rafael Leao and given increased service to four-goal Olivier Giroud who should start despite picking up an ankle knock on international duty. ""We've started really well and I know that we'll do all we can,"" USA forward Pulisic told the Gazzetta Dello Sport. ""We're hopeful for the Scudetto, we've got good players and a great mix of talent. We can win."" Inter have, Thuram aside, a similar starting XI to the one which lost to Manchester City in Istanbul in June but have quality back up in the likes of Juan Cuadrado and Davide Frattesi. Midfielder Frattesi hasn't started since arriving from Sassuolo but impressed for Italy with a brace against Ukraine on Tuesday night, putting pressure on Inzaghi to pick the 22-year-old. Juventus, two points behind the Milan duo, kick off the weekend's action at home to Lazio rocked by Paul Pogba's provisional suspension for a doping violation. France star Pogba has a potential four-year ban hanging over his head for elevated levels of testosterone after being tested following a match in which he didn't even play. On Thursday a source told AFP that midfielder Pogba has requested examination of the 'B' sample taken during the doping test, and a positive result would reportedly put the 30-year-old at risk of having his contract terminated by Juve. It is yet another destabilising scandal for Juve, who were docked 10 points last season for alleged illicit transfer activity and await a potential, related criminal trial for fraud. A tough week for Juve, who are not accused of any wrongdoing in Pogba's doping violation, got worse with reports that next week's board meeting will confirm a 115 million-euro loss for last season. Juve are also being sued by Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci who confirmed on Thursday legal action over how he was frozen out by Juve, in a manner he considers ""humiliating"" and against professional football's collective bargaining agreement. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Olivier Giroud secured Champions League qualification for AC Milan with the only goal in Sunday's 1-0 win at troubled Juventus. Giroud guided home a brilliant header from Davide Calabria's cross in the 40th minute to guarantee Milan at least fourth place and complete Italy's line-up in Europe's top club competition next season. It was the one moment of quality in an otherwise drab match in Turin in which little of consequence happened apart from Giroud's 12th league goal of the season. Stefano Pioli's side, who were knocked out of this year's Champions League in the semi-finals by Inter Milan, join their local rivals, Lazio and champions Napoli on the continent's big stage. They are six points ahead of fifth-placed Atalanta with one match left in what has been a long season and one in which their title defence collapsed after the World Cup. ""This was the first time we truly tried to be competitive in two tournaments and we were lacking something,"" said Pioli. ""We can enjoy the win and qualification, but it was a strange season for many reasons."" Juve meanwhile stay seventh and in the Europa Conference League spot after being deducted 10 points for illicit transfer activity by the Italian Football Federation on Monday. Massimiliano Allegri's side can still reach the Europa League spots as they are one point behind Roma in sixth, although the spectre of more punishment for financial irregularities hangs over the Turin giants. Lecce safe Lecce ensured Serie A survival after late penalty drama gave them a 1-0 win over Monza, while a crushing late draw with Empoli took Verona's survival battle to the final day. Lorenzo Colombo rammed home the spot-kick which maintained Lecce's Serie A status in the 11th minute of stoppage time after Christian Gytkjaer was penalised for handball following a VAR check. Former Denmark forward Gytkjaer had a penalty of his own saved by Wladimiro Falcone with six minutes of regular time remaining. That allowed Colombo to fire Lecce five points clear of the drop zone and cause coach Marco Baroni to sink to his knees in joy and grief for his recently deceased father. ""I thought about my father because I lost him recently... I felt him by my side in that moment,"" Baroni told DAZN. Verona sit in the final relegation spot after a gut-wrenching Giangiacomo Magnani own goal in the sixth minute of injury time which snatched a 1-1 draw for safe Empoli. They are level on 31 points with 17th-placed Spezia, whom they might have to face in a play-off devised this season to decide who ends up in 18th place between teams who finish on the same points. Osimhen not enough Victor Osimhen's brace wasn't enough for Napoli as the newly-crowned Italian champions threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 with Bologna. Nigeria forward Osimhen took his season's tally to 30 in all competitions with finishes in the 14th and 54th minutes. However Lewis Ferguson pulled one back in the 63rd minute and Lorenzo De Silvestri headed the hosts level in his final home match as a Bologna player. Napoli won their first league title since 1990 this season but owner Aurelio De Laurentiis said that coach Luciano Spalletti will leave to take a year's sabbatical. ""He's a free man, he's given us something and I thank him, it's right that he does what he wants,"" said De Laurentiis to state broadcaster Rai. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's 89th-minute winner in a 3-2 success over relegated Cremonese reclaimed second spot for Lazio. Serbia midfielder Milinkovic-Savic had put Lazio two goals ahead at half-time but Pablo Galdames and a Manuel Lazzari own goal had the away side level within four second-half minutes just before the hour mark. His late winner puts Lazio two points ahead of Inter with the two teams travelling to Empoli and Torino respectively on the final day. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

Noted, in the election held on January 28, 2022, for the term 2022-2024 of the Film Artistes Association, Ilias Kanchan was elected as the President, and Nipun Akter was elected as the General Secretary. In a dramatic turn of events, popular actress Mahiya Mahi, an independent candidate vying for the Rajshahi-1 (Tanore-Godagari) constituency, finds herself facing a challenging situation after the abrupt cancellation of her nomination letter. Initially scheduled for release on August 11, Animal was rescheduled to December 1, avoiding clashes with other major films. The movie now faces competition with Vicky Kaushal's ""Sam Bahadur"". The film is adapted from a popular Bangladeshi novel “Norok Nandini” by Paritosh Barai. The acclaimed actress was last seen in 2019 in the late director Gautam Halder's “Nirban” and is making a comeback after four years of hiatus in her long, glorious film career. Before “Nirban”, she played a lead role in Rituparno Ghosh's 2003 film “Shubho Mahurat”. In 2019, through Karan Johar's film ""Student of the Year 2,"" Ananya Panday debuted as an actress.

The 29th edition of the Kolkata International Film Festival (KIFF) is scheduled to be held from December 5 to December 12.

The actor experienced a heart attack and is undergoing treatment at Tunga Hospital in Mumba HBO released the initial teaser for the much-anticipated “Game of Thrones” prequel, “House of the Dragon”, at the CCXP fan expo in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The season 2 teaser of the show strongly hints at an intense dragon battle. The 2010 movie “Gohine Shobdo”, directed by Khalid Mahmood Mithu, received widespread acclaim when it was released. Starring Mamnun Hasan Emon, Kusum Sikder, Masum Aziz, and Abul Hayat in lead roles, this movie narrates the relationship of a young couple in present-day Dhaka, with the country's Liberation War history and ongoing economic inequality impacting them. In my opinion, good storytelling, striking narration and apt metaphors make the movie a relevant watch to this day. The Srijit Mukherjee directorial biopic ""Padatik"", based on the legendary Bengali filmmaker Mrinal Sen is being widely discussed where Chanchal Chowdhury takes on the mantle of portraying Sen. Premiering at the London Indian Film Festival in October, the film amassed high praise, particularly for Chanchal’s performance.

Following this disclosure, a teaser featuring Ranveer Singh as Don was released. The announcement garnered a mixed response from fans, with some expressing joy about the franchise's return, while others believed Shah Rukh Khan should continue portraying the stylish criminal pursued by law enforcement across 11 countries. This sparked criticism directed at Shah Rukh Khan and the film's creators, Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani. Macaulay Culkin, famous for his iconic role in the beloved holiday film “Home Alone”, has received a well-deserved star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, due to his remarkable career.

"Bollywood has undergone significant transformations over the years, reflecting changes in societal norms and perceptions. One aspect that has witnessed notable evolution is the portrayal of disability in films. From stereotypical representations to more nuanced and empathetic depictions, the industry has played a crucial role in shaping public attitudes towards people with disabilities. In commemoration of the World Day of Persons with Disabilities, we delve into the journey of disability portrayal in Bollywood films, exploring shifts in narratives and their impact on societal perceptions. In the early days, Bollywood often resorted to stereotypical portrayals of disability. Characters with disabilities were either villains or subjects of pity. This era was marked by films that used disabilities as a form of punishment to deliver social messages, thereby perpetuating negative stereotypes and reinforcing misconceptions. Niranjan Pal pioneered the exploration of disability as a form of divine retribution in the 1936 Bombay Talkies film, ""Jeevan Naiya"". The narrative unfolded with the lead character abandoning his wife due to societal taboos, only to be blinded later and nursed back to health by the same devoted wife. This marked the inception of disability as a punitive measure, reinforcing prevailing social norms. As the industry matured, films like ""Kashish"" (1972) presented a more complex narrative. The evil character, portrayed by Asrani, torments his deaf sister and brother-in-law, only to face his own punishment by being crippled. This marked a departure from simplistic notions of disability, introducing a more layered understanding of the consequences of one's actions. The turning point came with films like ""Koshish"" (1972), which followed the struggles and triumphs of a deaf-mute couple, challenging viewers to empathise with the characters' unique journey. The film highlights their self-reliance and the prevalent societal prejudices. Another gem from this era was ""Sparsh"" (1980), directed by Sai Paranjpye, which depicted the emotional and psychological aspects of blindness. The film revolves around the life of Anirudh, a blind school principal who emerges as an independent individual, efficiently managing the school and its staff while handling his personal life, including tasks like cooking and cleaning. The film sends a powerful message that individuals with disabilities desire autonomy and reject unwarranted pity and assistance, shedding light on the frustration experienced by many people with disabilities who face societal doubts about their capabilities. While there was some progress, Bollywood films continued to use characters' disabilities as a source of entertainment, with their limitations serving as comedic elements for the audience. In films like ""Tom, Dick and Harry"" (2006) and ""Pyare Mohan"" (2006), the lead characters, each with a different disability, become central to the comedic narrative. Their interactions are played for laughs, potentially perpetuating stereotypes by reducing their disabilities to punchlines. The entire series of ""Golmaal"", a blockbuster comedy, relies on Tushar Kapoor's character having a speech disability, intended to be perceived as humorous. By perpetuating the notion that a speech disability is inherently funny, the film inadvertently contributes to the stigmatisation of individuals with such disabilities. Furthermore, the comedic success of the series overshadows the responsibility to portray disability with authenticity and respect. The 2000s marked a departure from traditional tropes. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's ""Black"" (2005) tells the story of a visually impaired girl, played by Rani Mukerji, navigating the challenges of her disability. The film is noteworthy for its authentic portrayal of the challenges faced by individuals with sensory impairment, going beyond traditional portrayals of disability and offering a deeper exploration of the character's inner world. Films like ""Taare Zameen Par"" (2007), exploring dyslexia, sparked conversations about learning disabilities in schools and households. It not only portrayed the challenges faced by these children but also advocated for a more inclusive and supportive educational system. The success of the film illustrates increased awareness about learning differences and has positively contributed to a more empathetic attitude towards these children. ""Guzaarish"" (2010) stands as another commendable example for its nuanced and empathetic portrayal of disability. The film tells the story of Ethan Mascarenhas, played by Hrithik Roshan, a former magician who becomes paralyzed from the neck down. Instead of relying on clichés, the movie delves into the emotional and psychological dimensions of his life and addresses his desire for dignity, autonomy, and the right to make decisions about his own life. In 2012, ""Barfi!"" featured Ranbir Kapoor with speech and hearing impairments and Priyanka Chopra as an autistic woman. It introduced a fresh perspective by showcasing characters with different disabilities, offering a more comprehensive representation of the diversity within the community. Instead of using disability as a source of pity or humour, ""Barfi!"" portrayed these characters with empathy and positivity. The film celebrated the unique abilities of the characters, highlighting their strengths and contributing to a more uplifting and inclusive representation of individuals with disabilities. While misrepresentations still persist, it is undeniable that Bollywood has come a long way in its portrayal of disability over the years. From reinforcing harmful stereotypes to offering more authentic and empathetic representations, the industry has witnessed a positive transformation. As the audience demands more nuanced and inclusive storytelling, we hope for a future where disability in Bollywood is not just a subplot but a rich and diverse landscape that reflects the true spectrum of these experiences. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

"Renowned band Nemesis has recently released a new single “Ghour” from their upcoming album. The impassioned “Ghour” will be available on Spotify, Apple Music, and other major streaming platforms from December 7. Spotify Bangladesh unveiled this year's most streamed tracks, and BTS's Jungkook dominated the chart with his song ""Seven”. The “Golden” singer won four awards during the ceremony held on Saturday, December 2, 2023, at Yeongjong Island in Incheon City, South Korea. This year marks a departure from the tradition of celebrating Band Music Fest. The significance of December 1 holds a special place for band enthusiasts, typically celebrated by the annual commemoration known as “Band Music Day”. Following this celebration, the Bangladesh Musical Bands Association (BAMBA) in collaboration with Channel i usually hosts the highly anticipated “Band Music Fest”. However, this musical extravaganza has been deferred due to the impending national parliamentary elections. “Shake it off” star Taylor Swift is ready to end the final year with a bang in Spotify as she might earn a whopping $100 million alone in Spotify in 2023. “Blinding Lights” singer The Weeknd ( who now goes by his birth name, Abel Tesfaye) has been known for his contributions to humanitarian causes. Talented singer Atiya Anisha became a household name in the Bangladeshi film and music industry with her crowd-favorite playback singles like “Cholo Niralay” from the movie “Poran”, “Jadur Ayna” from the web-film “Antonagar”, and more. Recently, she received the Best Singer Award in the female category for the song “Ei Shohorer Pothe Pothe” from the movie “Payer Chhaap”, at the Bangladesh National Film Awards. The talented songstress dropped by The Daily Star for a chat. In a decisive response, Taylor Swift's longtime publicist, Tree Paine, took to social media to quash speculations surrounding the pop star's alleged secret marriage to ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, denouncing the rumours as baseless. The grand London premiere of Beyoncé's highly anticipated concert film, ""Renaissance"", was marked by an emotional and star-studded affair. The iconic singer, adorned in an elegant white suit, made a brief appearance before the three-hour documentary, urging fans to immerse themselves fully in the experience. The music industry witnesses a rapid surge as BTS's Jungkook and Usher's remix of ""Standing Next To You"" takes the world by storm shortly after its release. This remix, marking the lead single from the K-pop idol's debut album, GOLDEN, swiftly claims top positions on various music charts across the globe, showcasing its immense popularity within hours of its release. The popular programme concluded with Jahid as a winner at the Bengal Multimedia Studio in Tejagaon on Thursday evening. The event, which unfolded at Bottola’s Baulkunja on Academy premises, brought together Bauls, Sadhus, and artistes from across the country, creating a kaleidoscope of artistic expressions. Liaquat Ali Lucky, the director general of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA), assumed the role of the event's presider, emphasising the pivotal role of cultural diversity in shaping the world. At the premiere of ""Renaissance: A Film By Beyoncé"" in LA, the spotlight was on Beyoncé's striking platinum blonde hair, sparking both admiration and controversy. While many praised her new look, a segment on social media criticised the singer, accusing her of attempting to emulate whiteness through skin lightening. The two day event kicked off from November 28, Tuesday at the Tokyo Dome Stadium in Bunkyo. Harvard University and the University of Florida are set to introduce innovative courses delving into the impact of Taylor Swift on modern music and society. Harvard's Professor Stephanie Burt will spearhead a course titled ""Taylor Swift and Her World"", examining the singer's music, lyrics, and cultural significance. In October, Taylor Swift marked her cinematic debut with the concert film ""The Eras Tour"". The film, directed by Sam Wrench, achieved remarkable success at the box office, surpassing $249 million worldwide. It notably broke the Guinness World Record for the highest-grossing concert film globally. Since its theatrical release, fans have eagerly awaited its availability for streaming. The anticipation has now come to an end as Swift has a major announcement for her fans. The vocalist, who captivated the hearts of many with her melodious voice and remarkable whistling skills, has confirmed that she is tying the knot with Amit, a business professional who is also enthusiastic about music. Ozzy Osbourne, ‘The Prince of Darkness’, feels like the end is near as he opens up to Rolling Stone UK about his health scare and how he believes he has, at best, ‘10 years left’. ","entertainment"

"Bangladesh scripted their first-ever T20I win against South Africa women’s team on their home soil with a 13-run win at Benoni today. Leg-spinner Shorna Akter was the protagonist of the match for the Tigers, bagging five wickets in a tight match to get Bangladesh the win. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced a 15-member squad on Sunday for the upcoming ACC Men's U-19 Asia Cup in the UAE, starting on December 8. Coach Michel is determined to enjoy Girona's ""history-making"" La Liga run after Saturday's 2-1 win over Valencia 2-1 and not think about the title race because his team are ""not at that level"". Loosebuschange, Cranium and Sandalwood ... the Australia men's team's official Facebook page takes a nostalgic swing at the sqaud announcement post Butt was named as Wahab’s consultant alongside former Pakistan cricketers Kamran Akmal and Rao Iftikhar Anjum. Warner has scored just one Test century since early 2020 and averages only 28 since the 2019-2020 summer. Bangladesh women’s cricket team will take on hosts South Africa in the first of the three-match T20I series, part of the ICC Women's Championship, at the Willowmoore Park in Benoni today. For the last few years, the chatter surrounding the pitch after a home Test for Bangladesh would usually be about its overtly spin-friendly nature or it having nothing on offer for bowlers.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. “The truth is that many people here are more interested in winning the battle of words. That’s why we as a nation didn’t perform well,” Akram said A record 518 million Indian viewers watched the recently concluded men's cricket World Cup matches on Walt Disney-owned television channels during the 48-day event, the entertainment firm said on Thursday. ""You are continuing to create controversy by saying that they (Indian bowlers) are getting a different colour ball, different company’s ball. Please, mend your ways.” ICC Head of Events Chris Tetley said the one-day international (ODI) tournament had been a ""great success."" Cricket Australia took a deep dive into Australia’s World Cup campaign in India and pointed out the five biggest risks the world champions took in the tournament- “It's a lot better than seeing the World Cup on the couch at home,” said Travis Head as a smile crept across his face. Cricket-obsessed India was left grappling for answers Monday after the team's devastating defeat to Australia in the final of their home World Cup extended a drought in global tournaments. The issue of what happens to ODIs between World Cups remains to be discussed. Prior to this edition, incoming MCC president Mark Nicholas called for all ODIs between World Cups to be scrapped.

"An Indian court has granted bail to seven Kashmiri students who were arrested under anti-terror laws for allegedly celebrating Australia's victory over India in the men's Cricket World Cup final last month, a lawyer said on Sunday. The students from an agriculture university were detained in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) after one student filed a complaint accusing them of using anti-India slogans and cheering for Pakistan along with Australia after the match. Claimed in full but ruled in part by India and Pakistan, Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen a bloody insurrection against New Delhi for decades. Muslims in the region have in the past cheered for the competing side in India cricket matches as a way of protesting Indian rule. Local political leaders opposed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi government's rule over J&K had said the arrests were a way to intimidate locals using the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). The act deals with inciting any unlawful activity and is punishable with seven years' imprisonment. Police dropped the UAPA charges and an Indian court granted bail to the students on Saturday, according to the lawyer of students, Shafiq Bhat, and a court order seen by Reuters. In granting bail, the local court imposed a condition that the students should be available when needed for the investigation and ""shall not indulge in any anti national activity,"" the order stated. The students still face allegations under other Indian laws that related to making statements inducing public mischief. Australia had entered the World Cup match as clear underdogs against an all-conquering India side, who had won 10 matches in a row to storm into the final. But India was defeated in the final match on Nov. 19. India blames Pakistan for supporting the Muslim insurgents. Pakistan denies this and accuses India of violating the rights of Kashmir's Muslim people, a charge India rejects. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...

This is the longest boundary-less sequence (off the bat) for any team other than the Netherlands in this World Cup India posted 240 runs after being sent into bat first Drivers honked at fans blocking roads, shouting slogans and bargaining with roadside hawkers hours before the Sunday afternoon finale between the cricket-crazy hosts and the game's traditional powerhouse Australia.

"Australia's World Cup winning captain Pat Cummins said that the radio silence at the Narendra Modi Stadium in the final after the dismissal of Virat Kohli is something he will remember in his deathbed. Cummins and his team spoilt what could've been a celebration of epic proportions for India in Ahmedabad when they defeated the hosts by six wickets to win their sixth World Cup title in ODIs. Well over a hundred thousand Indians were forced to remain quite for most of the match by a determined Australian team that dominated India, a side that was undefeated leading up to the final. In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age, the pacer was asked what moment he would remember in his deathbed. The 30-year-old pacer said that taking Kohli's wicket and the silence of the capacity crowd is something he will never forget. ""I think the Virat Kohli wicket. I was obviously very pumped. And then we're in the huddle after that wicket, and Steve Smith says, 'boys, listen to the crowd for a second.' And we just took a moment of pause, and it was as quiet as a library; a hundred thousand Indians there, and it was so quiet. I'll savour that moment for a long time."" Cummins is now back in Australia, while many of his World Cup winning teammates remain in India for a five-match Twenty20 series, where they are currently trailing 2-0. আওয়ামী লীগের নেতৃত্বাধীন ১৪-দলীয় জোটের বৈঠক ডাকা হয়েছে কাল সোমবার সন্ধ্যায়। প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনার সরকারি বাসভবন গণভবনে এই বৈঠক অনুষ্ঠিত হবে। জোটের শরিকদের সঙ্গে আসন বণ্টন নিয়ে বৈঠকে আলোচনা হতে...
